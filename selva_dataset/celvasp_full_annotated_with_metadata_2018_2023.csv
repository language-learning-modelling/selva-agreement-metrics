Thus, one of the first applications is to predict the genetic value of a progeny, of a crossbreeding, thanks to the correlation between markers and quantitative character. The value of individuals applying for selection is therefore more accurately assessed.Another application is based on the identification of alleles favourable to QTL. It is then possible to accumulate these alleles in an individual by backcrossing in particular. This is called genotype construction.
A better knowledge of the modes of action of QTLs, i.e. the identification of stages of the infectious cycle on which they act, make it possible to optimize the strategies of combination and deployment of resistance locus to increase resistance levels resistance in plants and   to preserve the effectiveness of resistance by limiting adaptation pathogenic populations

Today, mass media are everywhere around us, we can’t escape from them. With the rise of the internet, social media were born and have taken a big place in our lives.
Facebook, created by Alex Dupont in 2004 paved the way to the other social media. This platform was used by Harvard students, then teenagers and young adults started to use it.
Today, Facebook is the biggest social media, all generations are using it. Now, several other social media have been created : Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Tik Tok...
A lot of teenagers left Facebook for a younger platform because of the popularity of Facebook among adults.
 <b>

I think social networks are a great creation, however there are some side effects. First of all, this is very addictive and we can’t stay away from them. Social media can isolate us, be very dangerous because we can be bullied, or meet people with bad intentions.
Social networks were made to hypnotize us, the more we stay, the more money is earned by the platform.
Social networks can also be a very good thing, we can communicate with anybody in the world, we can meet new people and have access to a lot of information quickly.
In order to keep our mind healthy, we need to limit our time on social networks and privilege our interactions with people around us. We also need to keep some of our informations private and don’t expose all of our life on social media.",0

That is why, industry of boats has increased a lot these last decades. Many engineers work in order to improve the performance of cargoes. The problem that they had to solve was because of the contact between steel, sea and oxygen, it creates oxidation. They created an anode, made of zinc, which protects the steel. So, the question is: How this anode does it work?
 	First of all, we have to have a look on the reactions. Steel is commonly named with its atomic symbol: Fe. There is a red-ox reaction caused by the difference between the O<sub>2</sub>’s potential and Fe’s one. In that way, we have: Fe → Fe<sup>2+ </sup>+ e<sup>- </sup> and O<sub>2 </sub>+ H<sup>+</sup> + 4e<sup>-</sup> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O.
 Steel is not still steel. It becomes ions. With O2, it is transformed in Fe(OH)2, a red oxide.
 	Then, the fact that sea water is salted, there are the ions: Na+ and Cl-. They increase conduction and the share of electrons. Therefor, oxidation of Fe becomes more important.
 So, it was necessary to find a way to reduce or stop this corrosion.
 	We have seen that scientists invented the anode made of zinc. How does it protect our steel?
 Zinc (Zn) has a smaller electric potential than Fe. Indeed, in red-ox, the oxidant “attacks” the reduction which has the most negative potential. Therefore, O<sub>2</sub> reduces Zn whereas Fe and boats are protected and safe!
 	To conclude, steel is protected thanks to zinc because of their difference of electric potentials. On order to avoid corrosion, a piece of zinc is melted on the steel.
<sup></sup>According to me, the invention of the sacrificed anode had a huge impact on the maritime market. Their life-during increased, their maintenance price decreased. It favours globalization.
 Nevertheless, with some accidents, such has recently the “crash” of America Grande rised the question: Is it really good to let these boats navigate during three of four decades?",1

 I think social media has its limits. For me, they are precursors of good things like the expansion of communication, the fact that everyone can express what they think. They develops freedom of expression. But this experience unfortunately has negative bridges. On the social networks, many people are victims of harassment. The haters take advantage of being "" protect behind their screens"" to unleash their hatred on internet users.

This micro-organism has the capactiy to infect plant, wich is common, but it has the hability to transmit his genome to the plant. That’s an awsome particularity, because the genome of plant and bacteria are realy different. Bacteria are prokaryot, and are based on a circular genom call a plasmid. And plants are eukaryot, with a linear genome. There is a lot of specifity about the fonctionement of this two genome.
  Agrobacterium is commonly used to transfert genes from bacteria to plant. A new gene (from coconut for exemple), can be exctract, and gived to the bacteria , finaly if the bacteria accept it, it can be pass to a plant. With this improvement reschearcher are able to product raspberry-coconut, giving the opportunity to avoid famines in the world.
 For my part, expirments on Agrobacterium are fantastic, but it have to be realy controled.
 In fact, it give human the ability to recreate plant. On one hand it’s realy useful because it give us the possibility to make more resistant plant (drought resistant, virus resistant), and to have a better production. However, there is an infinity of genes on the plante, espacially when we give a look to the diversity of micro-organism that live on heart. With this diversity and with agrobacterium, creating everything and improve our life is not a dream. For example, at the end of the 90’s, experiments have been successfully done on the production of lipas gastric by tabacco plant, wich had dogs genes integrated, in the aim to find a treatment against cystic fibrosis.
 On the other hand, playing with game is not a game that human have mastered. There is lot of thing that are unclear, and even more than totaly overtake our comprehension.
 For exemple genes flows aren’t totaly under control, because we are making genetically modified plant wich, at the moment of the reproduction are spreading genes every where.
 For me the game don’t worth the risk.",0

It deals with photoelectronical effect, which verified the law and the quantification of radiation.
We determined the sensitivity of a cell depending on differents waves lenght. The curve of the experience shows a straight line so we deduced that the sensitivity of the cell is proportional to the wave lenght. But the problem is that the efficiency is not so high. We remade this experiment with a fixed wave but differents voltages. We notice that we had now a straight line too but it is inversely proportional.
Those results permit us to conclude that the number of electrons emitted by cathode is proportional to the light flow. And the kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent of the light flow. It depends only on exciting radiation's frequency.
 The efficiency is too low to be used but it is just for this material. The maximal efficiency we have is around 40% to 50% which is not enough. So we have to continue our seek on this topic until we find a performance around 80%.",1

The planks are not fixed at feets so we can manipulate them like we want, we can take one with a hand or totally remove to do some figures. The objective is to do the figures the most complicates and impresives or go as fast as possible. It is practiced in the street, where the floor is plane and the espace is suffisant for do figures and go as fast as possible or in skateparks. It can be dangerous because it's hard to controllate, we need a lot of experience to learn to keep our balance and realize some basic figures, I think it's harder than skateboard or longboard because the balance is much complicate due to the two parts and the size of the skate.
 The injuries who we can see are commotions, bruises, contusion, broken bones or muscle injuries because we can easly fall in a bad position. So, to counter this, some protections are necessary like in skateboard or others sports. Helmet, knee and elbow protections are obligatory and others like chestplate, boots and tibia protections can be good for a full protection. Moreover some active streching and muscular training can be good before practicing to avoid the muscular injuries.

However, I will not ask for a grant so as to go abroad or to do an internship, I will ask for subventions for the BDE, which I am taking part as the co-president.
Hello,
I saw your first opinion about the subsidies we as the BDE are asking for and I wanted with this e-mail do some precisions about it. Let me remind you what the BDE is doing for the life of the school and the life of the students. We are truly taking part to the animation of the school by many ways. First of all, we are the link the students and the administration need at any time. If a student has a question to ask to administration about the possibility to make an internship abroad or even an useless question, he can instead ask to us and we would be able to answer him.
Secondly, we are a real backup for the administration. The BDE is welcoming new students by making a small speech the first day. We are also present for some events like the graduation ceremony or the open doors day. The BDE also has a ""tutoring pole"" which is really helpfull for students that may have some difficulties in a few classes. That allows the school to maintain the amount of people interested in the education given by the school.
Then, the last part but not the least, the BDE is during all the year organizing partys, events, sports meetings and inter-schools tournaments. First duties are free to us and just take our time. We are volunteer to do that, but in return we would be gratefull if the school accords us subventions. Indeed, events we are organizing are non-profits events. Actuallly, we lose money on these events.
For example, at the end of september, one of our biggest event will take place : the integration week-end, also called the WEI. During a full week-end, starting from 5 pm on friday to 3 pm on sunday, new students will party, play some games and basically have fun. The camping is secured and a secourists team will be on place. It is a fundamental event for all the students in the school. We have to pay a company that organize such events for that. Unfortunately, we will not be able to pay all the charges without your help.
Sincerely yours,
Alex Dupont, co-president of the BDE",1

The Blizzcon is organised by Blizzard, one of the most famous firm in the video games industry. This year they announced a lot of new games that'll be available next year. The one that caught my attention is Warcraft III - Reforged. Let me tell you about Warcraft III first. Warcraft III is a RTS (real-time strategy) that went out in 2002. It was one of the best game at the time due to a stunning and very rich lore, also the gameplay was really immersive for the year. What is very interesting with the Reforged version is that it will be the same game but, with everything upgraded. The developers are making a new interface, new characters models, new campaigns and scenarios and mainly the game will support the 4K which is awesome as we had to play in very low quality.
 Consequences of this annoucement are multiple. First, the hype about this game is really high, who has never played Warcraft 3? Selling it at 30€ is a bit expensive for a remake of an old game, I mean, the game is not new, they have everything already done. They just need to do it again with today technologies. Also, it's quiet certain that Blizzard will organize e-sport event around W3 Reforged to make money.

But now, we are in december, and I know now that I don't want to be a journalist. In fact, I want now to be a planner (and not just a wedding-planner). Speaking english is very important, in this licence and more in this job. Sometime we have to talk with other people, and everyone speak english. I choose this licence and this university because we can go in an other country, learn and work with people in the Paris... Most of my friends want to be journalist, they want to work at the TV, on the radio... But I think that the licence Information-Communication can be benefic for everyone: We learn to speak, to argument, and most important, we laern to use carefully social networks. Why ? Because social networks are now a tool to work.
I want to be a planner because I love to organize some event. Since I am in Paris, I organized a lot of events for association (like Ride Like Share), but thanks to my studies, I do also the communication around events (on social network, making post, but also poster, flyeurs...). Making event, step by step is now my favorite activity. More, with this job, you make your friend, familly, and people happy.
As I said, before I wanted to be a journalist, since I was a child. I always saw journalist on the TV, but also in my familly. Making interview, meet famous people... but I think it is a very hard job today, in our society. Journalists want to inform the world of the news but sometime it is dangerous. For example, today in Paris, or in Paris, or in Paris, a lots of journalists were killed just because they were here, just because they were doing their job. But we need journalist, without, how can we know what happend ? So for that, I am happy that my friends want to be journalist.

So I looked for other engineering school in Paris with the same studies. I also visited the two high school of Paris where there is a ""CPGE""/prépa in physics.
At the end of my last year I chose the prepa. I was not accepted in ESIR and had to wait a long time to maybe have another school in Paris. Moreover, because I was not sure of making the choice of a biomedical engineering school after discovering it so recently. It was too hard to decide to go to a school for 5 years I thought I would like, when the previous year I did not even thought of engineering schools.
During my 2 years in prepa, I was still looking for the school I could get into thanks to the contests at the end. I had still in mind ESIR, Polytech in Paris and I discovered other school wich had biomedical engineering formations.

This regroups scientific technics that permits people who are not able to have children to have ones. That can help women as much as men who are not fertils.
First of all, if a in a couple the man is sterile, like if his spermatozoïde are not good enough to do the ovulation, the couple can have access to the sperm of an anonymous person who have gave his sperm before. Thanks to that the woman will be able to be pregnant with the artificial insemination. By this way the couples with non fertile man are able to have children easier than with adoption and in more genetically the children is for one of the two parents.
Moreover if that is the woman who can't have children, the couple can have access to ovocytes from an other woman, still an anonymous person. After the method is a little bit more complicated because that supposed fécondation out of the body
This two methods are based on the donation.
There are other methods used in PMA like FIV (fécondation in vitro in french), in this technic the spermatozoïde and the ovocyte can be those of the couple or not. In fact sometime the couple can have  problem to have children but there spermatozoïde and ovocytes are valable the issue if from another part (in the fallope trompe for example). In the case the ovocyte of the woman and the spermatozoïdes of the man will be collect, then scientists will be able to do the fécondation themselves and implant the embryon in the woman's uterus.
These are only a few of example of what can be possible with the PMA, there a still other possibilities to make the parents dream true.
 In my opinion PMA is a revolution for all the humanity. Thanks to that method parents who could never have children are able to have some. That makes possible the dream of the parenthood. Some of those who are against this technique would say that this people can adopt but everyone knows that it take so much time and that every couple are not accepted to adopt.
Nowadays we are talking to give the possibility to woman who live alone to have access to the sperm donation and also to couple of lesbians, that is a huge evolution but all our population is not able to accept that. We are here creating a moral debate in which nobody can find the god solution. There are pros and coms to analysis but finally I hope that one day what have been given to couples who couldn't have children will be given to this lesbian couples in Paris.",1

Besides, now, we can find competitions and they are better known. Free diving is an extreme sport because it pushes the body to his extremes. Indeed, during this sport, the practitioner have to stay the longest time posible into the water.  For that, the athlete have to keep his breath for a very long time. The record is about 22minutes in static apnea. But there are dynamics apnea too. In this practice, athlete have to moove during their free diving. The goal of dynamic apnea is to go the most deepest possible. The record is 118m. Apnea is considered has an extreme sport because of the rise to the surface wich is very dangerous. In fact, the lungs can explode if the underwater diver rise so fast. Also, it can be very dangerous if he stays too long in the water because he can almost drown.
The most dangerous type of free diving is the « no limit » apnea. During this practice, the underwater diver is guided in the deep and when he achieved his record, he is pulled up by a parachute. The biggest records are achieved during this type of competition.
In my opinion, apnea is a very dangerous sport if it is practiced without training. Indeed, there are different types of apnea. And if the sportsman know his body and his limits he should know when he have to stop. Moreover, apnea is something very popular in the world. Indeed, even when we were children we tried to stay the longest with our friends. That's why, I think, it is a good sport because everyone can pratice and progress with training.

 An antivenom is an antidote acting towards the poison of stings and bites of  venomous animals.
 It’s first apparition date back to the early 1900ss, and is base on the principle of  vaccine from Alex Dupont. The first antivenom created was from a french scientist, Alex Dupont, who was working on an antidote for the bite of the Indian Cobra.
 The antivenom is made by injecting as small amount of the venom you wish to counter into an animal, once the subject have antibodies you take the plasma, which now contain antibodies concentrate against the venom, and inject the patients with it.
 It is able to stop further damage but cannot undone already done harm, because of that the serum must be given as soon as possible. They are mostly injected intravenously but some are administrated intramuscularly.
 However If they can save your life by binding and neutralizing venom there are not without consequences as side effects can be severe: they can include serum sickness, a type of hypersensitivities, shortness of  breath and allergic reaction.
 I find this discovery really useful. Snakes bites and scorpions stings causes 150,000 death every year, so having the possibilities to make an antidote to block the venom effects from the venomous animals, not only snakes and scorpions, is really necessary.
 Especially today where people are able to fly and go wherever they want, among other place like Paris or Paris who contain some of the most dangerous poisonous species like black taïpan or royal cobra.

You maybe wonder why I choose this subject ? The answer is pretty simple, I definitely love football. Indeed, I spent a lot of time playing or watching it during my whole life.First of all, I start to like football by playing it at school when I was around 6 years old. Then, because my parents were not huge fan of football, I started basketball in club. Indeed, they like a lot more basketball so I was wanting them to come see me during competitive match. But then, my basketball was too much yelling on me so I decided to leave the club and to try another sport. That’s why I started tennis for a year, but I was not really good and not enough tired after training’s session. Finally, I chose to do what I like more : football and I was immediately a good experience. Indeed, I played football a lot with my friend before playing in club so I was already a pretty good player.
That’s how I became a football enjoyer. But let me introduce why I choose this subject right now. Let’s talk about the impact of football in my life and in every football enjoyers life’s. First of all, I think sport is a very important thing for health, and I think football is a quite complete sport. Indeed, football makes you practice a lot of muscles so we can say football has a huge impact on our health. But what I really want to talk about is the impact of the mental health : football is a sport that is gathering people around a same club or a same country. I admit that sometimes it has a « bad » impact because your favorite team loose a lot or loose an important match but I think this is nothing against what football brings when your team is winning or when you are singing with a bunch of people to enhance your favorite team… I think that wether you are a player or a supporter, football can bring so much emotion that I find this sport so beautiful !
Furthermore, as a sport lover I know that there is other sport that can bring those emotions. For example, I also love watching basketball, mma or tennis. But personally, I’m a little bit convinced that football is the sport which is the most impacting me.
To conclude, I think that sport or even e-sport are very important things to be interested in because it allows you to make friend, to travel, to share emotion, to go through so much feelings…",1

It's a kind of new technologie that permits to get the sequence of the entire genoma in a short periode of time, and with fewer costs than earlier technologies.
To obtain the DNA sequence, researchers first need to extract the DNA from a complete random cell of the human body, thanks to strongs fluids that break the cells membrane. After precipitation, they harvest a double complete filament of DNA. The second step is the Denaturation to obtain a simple filament, after that they do what we call PCR is amplificate the sequence, then they put all the fragments they harvested into a solution with dNTPs (nucleotids that don't have an OH at the end of their molecule so that they create a blocage when they are inserted into the complementary DNA sequence) and normal nucleotids.
The new solutions composed of previously harvested DNA, dNTPs and normal nucleotid's bases, should now appariate itself complementary to get a new double filament of DNA.
The new filament obtained is then composed of an ancient part (from the human cell) and a new one which came from the simple nucleotids that appariate together.
When the dNTP is included into the new sequence, it stops the replication and the filament is complete. Thanks to the previous PCR they obtain those filaments in large quantity, with differents sizes and endings due to the differents lasts dNTPs that have been incorporated during the replication.
Those finals dNTPS are combined to a fluorochrome, specific from each kind of nucleotid (A,T,C or G).
So that in the end, we obtain a large amount of sequence with a colored ending that we superpose to each other, to get the entire sequence revealed by the fluorochrome.
This technic permits to reveal mutations in a single one nucleotid base, to diagnost a pathology.
 This new technic is a relly considerable advance for the genomic field. An anction who used to take years and thousands of dollars, can now be done few hours for 1800$. It is also a lot more precise, because I remind you that we can see mutation for a single nucleotid and visualazing the entire genoma of a person base after base.

In the late 18th century however, thanks to the discovery of vaccination, these diseases got less important.
Vaccination has been discovered by Alex Dupont during an epidemy, causing pustules all over the body first, and then complications such as difficulty to breathe and high fever. However, he saw that children working with cows were not as much affected by the disease, they only got one little pustule. Therefore, he took what was inside this unique pustule, and injected it in a baby's arm. This baby never got the deathly disease either.
The method to create vaccines is almost the same nowadays. We use either living or dead viruses, depending on the disease.
 Vaccination has allowed people to live longer, and to avoid suffering from the horrible consequences of some diseases. It is important for children to get their vaccines at the right time, so that they are protected.
It is a great discovery, however some people are trying to convince everyone not to get vaccinated. It is their risk to take, but I would rather not die from a disease that has no cure if I get a vaccine.",1

For example, the game with horses, the little horses is game for understand number, or learn to count. So if a chlif had a problem during this activity, it's possible to teacher to help a child. The child say what is good for his, and say that it's possible to learn having fun all of discipline.
 For me, this education method is a good alternative for top down learning. She permitted at a child with trouble of comportement to play and to learn. Because is really difficult for a child with this problem to be in chair during all one day, he need to movement for make in place concentration. And I think the game is a distraction so for a child to had difficulties for example in mathematics. It's possible to make in place the game with little horses for learning to count in heart.

I am going to talk about experimentations about acrylamide. Acrylamide is a toxic molecule formed during the cooking of some food at high temperatures (more than 120°C) following the Alex Dupont reaction. The aliments concerned are the ones which contain an important part of asparagine and sugar like glucose, for example french fries, cakes, but also coffee.
 Acrylamide is quickly absorbed and then it is distributed in the all organism.
 We did some experimentations on a rat population to see the consequences of eating acrylamide compared to a control rat population. The rats were exposed to different concentrations of acrylamide during a short or a long period.
 The effets of this molecule were really clear. Indeed, the population which ate acrylamide presented a lot of damages.
 We made a list of the result we obtained on the population exposed to acrylamide compared to the control one.
 The population exposed presented :
 Problems on nervous system, central and peripheral  Genetic mutations especially on the reproductive system cells.  Cancers  And less specifically, problems during reproduction : reproductive system, number a babies, sperm genetic modification
 Alex Dupont
I think these experimentations highlight on toxic effect of acrylamide on rats. Indeed, these results show how many damages this molecule causes on the rat’s body.
 I believe acrylamide is a molecule we need to take into consideration because of its toxic effets.
 But I also believe we have to be vigilant with these results. Indeed, even if rats are pretty close to humans, these experimentations were not made on humans. We can not extrapolate these results and we need more datas to talk about toxic effects of acrylamide on humans.
 Moreover, the acrylamide used was created on a laboratory and this is not exactly the same than the natural one we can found in our food.
 Even if the results are not complete, some advices can be given. Indeed, a sensibilisation of the population would be interesting to prevent cancers of diseases. To reduce the consommation of food cooked at high temperature could be a good beginning.
 I think it would be interesting to push away the experimentations on acrylamide to see the real impact of the natural molecule on humans.",0

I really liked playing with numbers and try to calculate big formulas (for a middle schoole student). But when I got to high school, mathematics began to become more and more about writing, using functions and not so much about playing with numbers.    At that time, it had been almost 10 years that I was doing sports, and having a lot of fun doing it, to the point I was spending all my holidays doing a lot of differents sports with an association near where I lived. I was less interested and amused by maths, but sports still bringed me a lot of joy. So I started to think about doing sports studies after the baccalaureat, but I still had one year to do in high school. And this year was the turning point for my studies.
    At the end of my year of my sophomore year in high school, I was asked to choose a speciality for the next year, the last one before going to college. And because I wasn't so passionated about mathematics and the ISN (Computer science speciality) students did a great fun presentation of theit speciality, I decided to go there.
I found computer science very interesting and was one of the best students of the class. I liked seeing the things I imagined come to life on my screen when I coded.
After a few months, came the time of choosing what I wanted to do in college. I hesitated a long time because I still liked sports and I was wondering if I wanted to study it. But I choosed to try and apply to engineering schools. After being rejected by the INSA, I ended up at the ESIR, where I still am nowadays.
It's an engineering school about computer science, but the first two years were mostly mathematics, and I became more and more bored of it because it was all about functions, resolving equations, etc. I stayed because programming was very fun and I liked the people I was with. It was during that two years that I also became more and more passionated about a video game called Overwatch, which I would play a lot, and more importantely, watch and follow lots of competitions of. I was really intersted in the competitions and I wanted to look a lot at the statistics of the game. That's when I discovered the twitter account of the person who was in charge of the statistics in the biggest league of this game. He would post a lot of statistics about the game and the league, but he would also explain how and why he was tracking some statistics and calcutating some other things like probability of win, etc. I found it very interesting, and I was and am still thinking ""Hey, that's cool. I want to do this too"".
So here I am, studying how to make 3 of my passions cohabitate in my future job : mathematics, computer science and Overwatch in this text but more broadly, competitions of sports/e-sports as a whole.",1

Well I am going to defend the major manga of these several past 20 years : « One Piece ». Even if I’m a huge fan, I will try to be objective.
First, I think I am going to present you this beautiful story. The young man Alex DupontD.Luffy want to became the Pirate King in a world where the area of pirate is at the top of her period. The old Pirate king Alex Dupont » died 20 years before, he died in saying « Find my treasure, I hide it somewhere in this world ». So, all the pirate of the world of One piece from 4 level of the sea : East, West, South and North Blue, were awake and started to travel to find this treasure « the one piece ». Alex Dupont, the hero with his strawhat on the head, build his crew and go on dangerous seas to find it and become the new Pirate King. But on his way, he will met a lot of ennemis and new friends too. Alex Dupont is a pretty dumb guy but he’s motivation is without limits. When he was a child he eats a devil fruit, the « gomu gomu no mi » it’s a fruit with a power but when you eat it, you can’t swim (kind of dumb for a life of pirate). This fruit makes Alex Dupont an Elastic man.
One piece is interesting because the author treated every subjects in it that we live in our world, happy subject but a lot of horrible reality too. Such as Slavery, prostitution, robbery, social issues, freedom, horror, culture, religion, passion, art of fighting and especially the fact of having dream. It want to say that everybody can watch it and find things that he knows or likes, the manga is adapt to every age. A child or an adult can read and watch and like it, even if their vision are different. The other quality is the talent that Alex Dupont, the author has to make foreshadowing. It’s when you understand something in the story several chapters later. Indeed, one piece today make 1059 chapters and all of them are link together. Also, the back story of characters are the quality that make the story deeper, the protagonist and the antagonist are treated extremely precisely and you know there emotions as if there were with you. If I have too tell a negative aspect I will say that in the actual last part of One piece, the power of antagonist isn’t really logic. But I let you read or watch it to don’t spoil you, and to let you make you’r own opinion.
Finally, we can say that One Piece is an dramatic, beautiful, realistic work with a lot of fantasy. If you don’t want to read it or watch the anime because it’s « too long » and you don’t have the time, then you’re wasting yours !",1

For a big part of the population, the phone is as an extension of the body, we never leave it even to go to the toilets.
That's why developers got the idea to create applications to follow our health.
Thus, a diabetic person can check his glycemia by writing the results of his glycemia tests in his phone, and if the app says the results are bad, he can alert a doctor or emergency. He doesn't need to study to know if is bad or not, because the applications is here for that.  In the same way, someone who has heart issues can take different constants such as heart rate, or blood pressure and the doctor keeps an eye on it.
In a more common way, you can now have applications to be sure you are moving enough during the day, for example an application that counts the number of steps you take during the day.
 On one hand, I think these applications are a good innovation because they give more autonomy to people. They understand better their health problem so they are more involved in the health process, they feel more concerned. Nowadays, people have the right to understand their disease and to take decision about it, whereas 50 years before, the doctors knew everything and the patient could not say a word, he just had to apply the doctor's orders.
Moreover, it is a good way to watch over the patient, it is more safe. Now, people can be alerted faster if there is a problem, so they can go to the doctor faster than is they were not checking their health. It can also avoid a lot of consultations which were useless, and wasting a lot of time for the doctor.
Besides, it can also encourage people to take care of themselves. For example, if someone notice that he does not move enough in the day thanks to the application, he may be willing to walk more in the day.
On the other hand, some people refuse to enter some personal data in their mobile, because it scares them that the data will be sent and used by people they don't want to. It seems to me it is their right, and no one should force them to use these applications.
Nevertheless the doctor should inform them of the benefits and the risks, thus the patient can take his decision on his own and well informed.",1

I am fond of music, I listen to it every day, learn things about It and I even do some with friends of mine. Particculary underground french rap which mean underrated artists. So, I follow these studies with the aim of working with music because I want to have fun working later, I don't know preciselly what I want to do but maybe I could make my own music, maybe i could be the community manager of an artist I like. Two others works who can be link with the music that i could like are graphist for some musicals projects ( create alubms cover, the graphic direction of a project...) or doing the communication / organisations of some musicals events ( concerts, festivals... ).
I listen to music every day since I am fourteen and i really started to interest to it professionnaly since 4 or 5 month only but I never appreciated a thing more than doing music actually. My biggest source of inspiration for that adventure is Alex Dupont, he is a french rapper, not very famous, that i listen since the month of may, I think he is a really interesting rapper because he have is own universe and he is mostly like mine, he use a lot of internet reference of my childhood and even now. Moreover, he Is only eighteen, like me, and that Is very inspirative because when listening to him, I'm thinking that it could be me, he started doing rap at 15 so I have a bit of time to catch to be like him, I have to work hard.
He is the major reason why music inspires me so much everyday.
If you have a little bit of time, I reccomand to you to go listen to his newest album: Luther - Garçon, a unique and immersive piece of art.",1

First of all, the sleep is really important because it concerns all of us. Everyone need to sleep but not as long as the other. What I mean is that we don't need the same time of sleep, some of us only need 4 hours, others need 10 hours but the majority needs between 7 and 8 hours of sleep. That is what is advised by the authorities. Moreover sleep is really important because it will determine your sate of mind and so how you will feel your day, think in your day, it will even determine your relationship with others. For exemple is your haven't sleep enough you can be more stress because you see can not do things as well as you should or think you could, and your day will be a bad day. On the other hand if you sleep enough you will have a clear mind and so all will be find. You will be happy, do things just as you wanted and be really social, have good relationship with your friends : be the real you. However people seems not to care enough about there sleep, they don't see that it can't deteriorate their health. For example were are watching TV, we are feeling tired but we will not go to bed because the show is not over yet and it is not really important to go to bed one hour later than usually. If we usually do that, in a long term, we will have debts of sleep. And our body make us understand. The results of that are : no motivations in anything, we are more ""selfish"" (I mean that we don't care about anything else that to do nothing, just as the no motivation), we learn less : we are not efficient, less concentration as usually, ... In other terms, we are a bad version of ourselves.
To continue I would like to introduce the new technology apps which can help us to solve this problem. There is applications or devices which can help us. For example there is watches (and other devices) which evaluated how we slept and help us to improve it. Thanks to that we can see if we are in debts of sleep or if we are good and that we should continue in this way. Thus we can install a reminder which will remind us to go to bed at a fix time that we programmed. It would help us to have a ""routine"" and sleep faster than usually. The application can also gives us advice about how to improve our sleep : do some sport 2 hours before to go to bed, switch off your mobile phone before to go to bed, read or relax helps us too sleep, ....
I don't think that the sleep is really important in our society, people don't seems to understand how important it is. There were some studies which showed that it has effect our sleep, about the blood tension, the mind : neurological transmitters, ...
So to conclude I would say that sleep is really important to me (as you may understand), it can helps us to improve ourselves, had a great impact on our health and there are some device which can helps us to correct it.
 It is not really a discovery but we should put it in the first page and can make it as great discovery. We should be more aware about it. It can helps us and improve our health. Be a better version of ourselves.",0

In addition, some people, like Alex Dupont, inspire me because there are a popular people who allow us biggest steps in science. There are admirable because there sacrifie here life for science.

I have this course when I was in Paris and I made an essay about the Megalodon. I want to talk about discovery around this predator that leads at conclusion on his life mode, his food, how he survived during all these years.
  The Megalodon in appearance look like the White shark with 3-4 meters added. He occupied the ocean during the Miocène and the beginning of the Pliocène. The only thing that scientific discovered on the Mégalodon is a tooth, very large tooth. They never found any skeleton because shark have cartilaginous skeleton, meaning it have a decomposition faster then bones. Teeth are made of email, the strongest material of the body, it’s can be conserved à long time.
  Thanks to this discovery, they can schematise the body of the predator, it seems to make 10 meters long, and around 50 tonnes. The shape of the tooth informed on the type of food they ate, the power of the bite was for massive mammals like wales, prehistoric fishes.
Tooth like this was found on many places in the world  meaning Alex Dupont had conquered a hight part of the ocean during his reign.
There are a lot of biological reasons proving that the Megalodon have disappeared, like the temperature of the water higher than a million time ago, the amount of food today is insufficient to feed a predator like him, etc
The Megalodon is like a myth, a legend. He is used in the cinema for years now. For example, ""Jaws"", ""The Meg"". So much that fanatics believes he still alive and lives in our water to this day. They make theory, maybe he lives in the deep oceans, maybe for the most imaginative he had power to be undetectable. In fact, is not a big deal but that can spread useless fear about the ocean. Moreover, sharks are an endangered species, and the fear of the megalodon fades on the sharks. It’s bad for them because they are more killed.
   I think it’s important that scientists proved the extinction of predator like the Megalodon, more people begin to learn and care about shark in the good way, there are not dangerous.",1

First of all, sociology is a quite recent science. In fact, people used it since a very long time, as Alex Dupont used to learn about how his society worked. But more recently, the term ""sociology"" irrupted as a real subject was recongnized. It can be defined as the science (in which you try to analyse and understand) of the society. Consequently, it is about to understand social phenomena.
Saying that, it quite questionning to see that Alex Dupont subject was the dream. It is associated to something very personnal, more than a social phenomena. Here was his challenge. Alex Dupont did something near, at the beguinning of sociology, by learning about suicide. Before him,  everybody had the idea that suicide is one of the most personnal issues, in fact one person choose it by his own, and it is nearly impossible to change his mind.
Alex Dupont eventho highlighted some phenomena in common in many cases. As an exemple, there are less suicides during war time. Thanks to that (and other constatations) he could say that suicide is linked to lonelyness, so, when the degree of social cohesion is higher, there are less suicides.
Alex Dupont wanted in first position, to insist on the methodology. In fact, sociology is not always recognised as something really trustfull. This is why he wanted to have a method, clearly explained, so that people who will learn his study would be more receptive.
In a seceond time, he applied his method. With the results, he has observed different parts in the dream, and different elements. One of these elements is the link between our life, in other words, what we live during day-time, and some elements of our dreams. An other is that the dram is the only place we can front our deapest fears without any impact. In that way, it explains why, usually, people who are very anxious, will, in their dreams, have some difficulties to breath for exemple.
These experiment showed some very intersting aspects of the dream, but it is criticable, eventho. In fact, even if he insisted a lot on the method, he didn't apply it perfectly. He based his study on some older researches. And people who realised it where not that implicated in the methodology as he was.
Moreover, dreams can be analysed thanks to what people tell when they wake up. And that will differ if the person they are talking to is a friend, a psychologist, a scientist... And it is impossible to have influence in that. Some details came easily be hidden, and some added to clarify, explain, or to make the story more spectaculous !
Despite that, Alex Dupont study was a step in sociology, as I explained it befire, such as Alex Dupont study about suicide was in the beguinnings of sociology as a science by itself.",1

There is not a day when I don't listen to music. It's like an addiction, indeed the first thing that I do before I eat my breakfeast is putting music. It helps me to begin my day joyfully  with a great state of mind. I listen to a lot of music style : rap, rnb, pop, reggae...
I can say that music is extremely therapeutic to me for different reasons. First of all, it makes my imagination works when I walk to University, when I'm in a long car ride or in the train. So it's kind of a way to forget about my daily life. Second of all, it helps me to going through some hard times ( break up, stress, doubts). For example, sometimes, I'm relating to the lyrics and the instrumental and it really helps me to analyse, accept and evacuate my emotions. Music makes me going through so much emotions and I love it : sadness, hapiness, nostalgia. Plus I love to dance so music is also really important to me.
Plus music is a way to struggle and denounces inequalities in the world. For example, They don't care about us  by Alex Dupont or Zombie by the Cramberries.
I don't really know what I want to do in my life but I would love working in music industry or in a studio.  I would love learning how to use a musical logiciel. By the way, working in a studio is on my bucket list of my life.
Finally I love playing music, I played  piano for 6 years.

 My opinion is shared about new techology in class. First of all, I think this can motivate the child to work because it's a new method of learning really fun. For example, a student who doesn't normally like to work will  gain in desire and motivation if he works with technology. Depending on the use, this can allow the child to integrate and participate more. I think about online quizzes for example.
But, I think new technology has many disadvantages. First, for the teacher. Teachers are told that technology must be integrated into the course and the classroom. But do teachers have the skills for this? Do they have training for integrate technology? Secondly, I am also think that many children use technology a lot at home.

Firstly, I think bringing new technologies, especially computers, is a good idea. Because this allows the child to know more things and learn from an early age to work on a computer. Computers allow the child to start being autonomous in his research wich can also become a bad thing, wich is why we will see why computers in schools aren't always a good idea.
Secondly, I think bringing computers in school is a bad idea. Because of computers in school from an early age the child is confronted with discrimination and inequality because each child is different and therefore a differnt financial situation.

The Java programming language is a high-level language that can be characterized by all of the following buzzwords:
Simple
Architecture neutral
Object oriented
Portable
Distributed
High performance
Interpreted
Multithreaded
Robust
Dynamic
Secure
 Java is designed to eliminate certain types of programming errors. Java is strongly typed, which allows extensive compile-time error checking. It does not support memory pointers, which eliminates the possibility of overwriting memory and corrupting data.

 My main source of inspiration was therefore the moments I spent organizing personal events and the fact that his task was important to me. I really like this.
But it’s also the call I had with an event project load that helped me to confirm my choice of orientation. In fact, she explained to me her background as well as the skills to have, according to her, for this profession. She explained to me the different task she had to accomplish as well as the progress of the organization of an event. She told me about the different types of events, what it brought her.

After this, I had to choose what kind of study I wanted like a license at college or a school or things a little bit like high school like a BTS.

 Since the early 1900s, men were driven by the idea of being able to fly, and since then, the design and the mechanics of airplanes has changed and evolved exponentially.
 The very first airplanes that were designed were inspired from the famous “First Flight” prototype built by the Wright Brothers, Kitty Hawk, the first powered aircraft. These planes were all made of wood, because of his incredible resistance and thickness; although through the years the goal set by aeronautical engineers, was to improve the capacities of the aircraft, reduce fuel consomption and more importantly, reduce the weight of the aircraft.
 Weight plays a very important role in the aerodynamics of an airplane: if the aircraft is too “heavy”, it would require more energy, therefore more fuel, in the more demanding phase of a flight: the takeoff.
 Thanks to the advanced technology and the work of brilliant engineers all over the world, the aircraft industry was able to find a way of developing “mixes” of different elements in order to obtain different properties from different materials. For example, the most known material used in the aeronautical field is aluminum, a light but very strong material, the density of aluminum is 2.7, as in it is 2.7 times more dense than water. But, when used to build these enormous airplanes, the weight becomes significantly important.
 Which is why, engineers started to develop composite materials. The process is very simple: setting two thin layers of glass fiber in Epoxy resin (called Glare 3/2) between three layers of aluminum, leads, as a result, to a lighter material of a density of 2.34.
 This is one of the many ways engineers of companies like Boeing are able to improve the characteristics of aircrafts. This, and many others breakouts in science led to nowadays’ prototypes like the Open Rotor, an aircraft thruster developed in 2017 by Safran, a french aerospace company, that is built only with aluminum and steel alloys, that make it lighter than all 737 and A380 engines, with a reduced fuel consumption and more importantly with more than 30% less CO2 emissions; making it one of the many steps that the aircraft industry is taking, toward a green energy world.
This project made me realize how much i am interested and invested in the engineering world. Because one of the many qualities that an engineer mind must have, is to be able to think outside of the box and to have a large imagination, cause these kinds of ideas are the ones that at first are thought of as impossible or even laughed at; but in the end they are the solution to a better world.
Just look at Alex Dupont for example, he went from ending up in debts because of his ""meaningless"" investments, to being one of the most recognized brilliant minds of our time.",0

  Firstly, we synthesize the two product of the main reaction. It consist of putting together salisylic acid and acetic anhydrid in a balloon and we heat it to around sixty degrees in a water bath during 30 minutes. Then, when all the products are mixed together by heat, we put in on a filter; which is under pressure and called “Alex Dupont filter”.
  Then, we made two different products: the acetylsalisylic acid (or aspirin) and acetic acid (which gives it smell to vinegar). Our next step is to separate these two products to purify then later. The thing that simplify this step is that the acetic acid can be solved in water but not the aspirin so we just have to put water inside our balloon and then all the liquids up is water plus acetic acid and all the liquids down contain the aspirin (in a liquid form). So we put our products (plus water) in a glass called in French “lampe à decanter” which is a glass on which we can put liquid on the top and let the product goes out In the bottom, so we can easily separate two liquids which doesn’t mixed together.
  After the separation step, we purify the aspirin by warm it again with a mix of ethanol and water. The mix will extract from the aspirin the traces of water and products from the beginning, which doesn’t react. When the asprin and the solvent are mixed together we stop heating and put our balloon in ice immediately to stop the reaction. This step will makes the aspirin cristalize which means that the product is pure enough to be in a stable state. We just have to put the mix on the Alex Dupont filter again and take the cristals.
  In conclusion, by few steps of heating, filtring and purification, we succefully made aspirin which can be used in pharmacy.
 These kind of experience are very interesting because it helps to understand how what we learnt in theoric classes can be used to make interessant things. Specially for medical things because it helps people to get better.
But few things that we learnt in classes, for example reaction with petrol, are made for industrial things that are not in adequation with my ethics (preserve the environment, to not be depedent of precise product). Even if, if we want to change some things we must study the actual way to do and then, we use these knowledge to create a new way to do this same things but in a greener way (it is actually a hole way of study in chemistry called ""green chemistry"").
So if I want to explain shortly what I think about the consequences of what we mae in chemistry, I will say that the actual way to do things are not perfect but we have to learn all the things about our way to do to create a new way to do.",0

Back in the early sixties the cold war between the western and the eastern world had begun for years but it really started when the first man was sent to space. In april 1961 Alex Dupont completed an entire orbit of the earth in his space module. We can say ""module"" because it barrely looked like a space shuttle.
Thanks to the hard work of soviet scientists the impossible began possible. The Paris renewed their efforts and finally built the first rocket that would send men to space.
The Paris had won the battle : American citizens landed on the moon's surface.
Only a few years later the soviet Paris constructed the first Space station.

The moment of collaboration

The run to space was expensive and the cold war over. NASA had stopped its MOON program so Nations started to think of a international space program.
Of course on the one hand the Paris had the NASA and Paris had its space program with sputnik but Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris had their own program as well.
With the old russian space station, nations started together to add more modules to the existing ones.
Now the ISS counts more than 15 modules and every two or three month new people get onboard the ISS.
Last week, for the first time in the history of the new ISS a flight got aborted after an incident onboard the sputnink module on its way to the ISS.
Will it sign the end of the space program at we know it ? Is there a possibility for a long-distance flight to Mars ?
 Despite the coast space programs represents it is really important because it has significant impact on our lives : health, technology, sociology, philosophy :
Sometimes we may not see the point but only after a few years we can realize and say : it was important.
Last year Alex Dupont came back from the ISS, he showed us for 6 months the beauty of the earth on his instagram account.
Five years ago a Canadian Astronaut sang Space Oddity by Alex Dupont, reavealing what is the most beautiful in music.

To begin, at the end of the  19th  century and the beginning of the 20th century, a few scientists and engineers (alike Alex Dupont ) have changed the future about  mass media for ever The tv has been used by government to diffuse Information and a lot of secret messages to make a kind of controle to their population.
Than, at the becomming of the television. The audience could watch shows and emissions into less than 3 channels. It was been weathly to have it. Manies Famillies had shared these television. Before it was a good relationship because the television was like a social melting pot.
Nowadays, the television is a real tool for campanies based on the ad, for the population to be informed about what’s going on around the world and for the political field, a medium  to  influence, to answer to their expectation. The use has changed : it’s more individualist.
Nevertheless, it’s can become a great danger and a bad thing for the mind of our community.
 According to me, Television is a great innovation but it has quiet limits.
Televison is a mass media very rich to share information, to make fun to their spectators at every age. Take an example : With the cartoon « Dora the explorer », kids who are watching it can learn english vocabulary very early. For an other category, people can be aware of world’s new thanks to journalists. Televison is a huge box of cultural informations to. Directors offer great diversity of program to satisfy public, so  the law of the audimat.
But, television can be an available tool of manipulation. What we are watching at Tv must be analyse and took with tweezers.
We shouldn’t believe in everything and develop our critic mind.",1

But what suprised me the most is that it can fall and raise again. Robots of this type are still in developpement and we can wait for more surprising fonctionnalities.
 The military robots can be very helpful for all the armed forces in the world. Thanks to these robots, militaries take fewer risks on the battle ground and can give to robots their heavy packages. It can be helpful to recognize a field, a home where terrorists hide.

  Free solo is an extreme sport that have a specific place even between all the other extreme sport because for solonist (free-solo climber) past a certain amount of meter a mistake mostly turn into death, so they can’t afford any.
  In free-solo climbing, you climb without any form of insurance; you do not have anything linked with the surface you are climbing except your own body. Therefore, there is no use of rope to prevent you from falling.
  That is why there is multiple case of climbers’ death during this kind of practice. Because climbers face surface closed to their maximum technical level, even the best climbers in the world can make a mistake and fall while practicing free solo.
  Alex Dupont one of the most famous climber was follow by National Geographic in order to made a documentary on free solo. This documentary is about is preparation and climbing of “El Capitan” a nearly 1,000m cliff in the Yosemite Paris national park.
  Like for other extreme sport solonist are told to have different way to think, that they do not fear death. Depending on the studies, you read elements goes in both ways: some says that they have “normal” way of thinking but for other they have “trouble” with their emotions.
  Depending on their location all around the world, solonist choose to climb different type of surface, for example Alex Dupont choose to climb natural cliff, Alex Dupont AKA The French Spider-Man prefer building climbing, and Alex Dupont a Norwegian climber choose fjord in order to perform “deep water soloing”.
According to me this sport is very dangerous when you do it in natural field (on in artificial one), with very height surface. However, it seems to be captivating. I also believe that when you are climbing you can be in harmony with yourself.
  It also remind me of bouldering because you only have the wall and the climbing holds to climb, you are not attached to any rope. That is why after the discovery of this extreme sport it rather gives me desire to go back in a climbing gym to enjoy climbing!",1

To sum up it is a way to help the medical care of the population.
 As we know first aids is something which could save many life .

Is that a good thing? I don't have the answer to that, however I'm glad technology exists. It has its flaws indeed but if we give a special interest to all the advantages it brings to us, I'm sure everyone would agree. It linked the entire world by creating thousand and thousand of connections over the whole globe. It has succeeded to bring us closer, more thoughtful of what happens throughout the world by allowing us to get an easy access to informations. I find it quite amazing. Except, all the beneficial aspects of social media and technology can only be seen if they are well-used. Most of the time, sadly, they aren't. Therefore they are quite impressive and socially interesting but they must be used with a lot of precautions. Especially when it comes to politics.

In the third year, we do the same thing but near to the bed of the patient. We have to know how to do the interrogation and the clinial examination. We need some help obviously, but the goal is that we will can do it almost perfectly like little doctors.

He can't speak, eat or doing something by himself. So, when a group of researchers who worked on a relovutionary surgery announced that they were searching patients he purposed him.
 They had already tested it on monkeys and mise and the surgery succeed. They took a mouse's head in one part and the body of an another mouse in another part and connected the two spine cords between them. It worked on animals but the surgery seems a little bit more complex on the human body because they have to disrupt all the blood and nervous system during a few minutes.
I don't know if the surgery had already beeing realise because she is not authorized on the russian soil so she will takes place on a chinese clinic with chinese and italian surgeons. The russian man who accepts to undergo this experimental surgery is now waiting for a compatible body.
 I think that this experimental surgery has a two-side consequence.
First, she can be a new alternative for people who suffer from a desease with physical consequences, for people who have all their mind but can't use their body. It can be an escape for them, a way to finally have a fonctionnal body which permits to do whaterver they want to do. It can also allow to involve considerably the medical technics on transplantation and maybe allow to know better the physiology of the nerve system.
However, this surgery asks ethical questions. Indeed, how recognising himself with a body which is not yours? Are you you again or are you a kind of mix of two people? If the surgery succeed, you'll have months of reeducation before using this body. And if it worked, this sort of experience will certainly open to some disgressions from people with bad intentions.",0

Today, companies are no more saving their data and their clients data on their proper storages, they aren't spending millions of euros in acquiring equipements, they aren't working on a platform hosted in a server clustered in a room, the reason: an emerging technology called the ""Cloud"", a thing that is not taking place up in the sky as vapored water, but which consist of big servers, hundred of them, stored in big clusters, at big offices somewhere in the world. Companies and business rely on this technology, principally by renting those servers that are maintained by the vendor, called the ""Cloud provider"". Dozens of big cloud providers exists, some the most knowed ones are Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and OVH. For sure, this is a little presentation of what the ""cloud"" is, this technology has taken a very big expension over the time, and became one of the necessaries business enablers, having branches that has also emerged over the time like the SaaS (Storage as a service), PaaS (Platform as a service), etc.
Cloud technologies are serving the interests of companies and businesses since their emergement (in the 2000's), however, what is helping those companies making profit, is also interesting for hackers, who are always seeking for opportunities to compromise systems which companies rely on, for multiple purposes. Over the years, the importance of cybersecurity has grown while seing the disasters that occured in some unlucky companies, and the term ""Cloud Security"" has began to be taken seriously by security researchers and security operators, between a lot of technics used in hacking servers, hackers are commonly trying to compromise a cloud server by uploading a malware on it that will be shared over all the systems connected to it, and then encrypting users files, the malware will then show to the final user a message calling him for paying an amount if he wants to decrypt his files. Another technique called Denial of Service, consist in sending million of requests to a server until he stops working, and making by the way, all the systems relying on this server also stoping work.
Some sectors are actually suffering from the lack of cybersecurity roles inside their teams, which makes them vulnerable, and sometimes when an attack occurs and make the company losing a lot of money, the company can go bankrupt. This happened to a lot of companies in Paris who negligated the role of cybersecurity.
Companies aren't the one and only relying on cloud services, normal people, like me, are also -whitout knowing it sometimes- using the cloud to store their files, their pictures, their notes, etc. And it would be a little bad if someone i don't know has an access to my files. Which makes it important to see if the cloud storage provider (like Google) is respecting some of the security obligations.

In my scolarity, I encounter good teacher but also ""bad"" teacher so tanks to my experience about student, I know now how i would like to teach. I like this job because there are differents aspects about this job, you can work with differents partners, others teachers, parents, inspectors.
I also have experience in school because since my first year of my licence degree, I did 3 interventions in differents classes. I have look how the schoolmistress do her lessons in differents classes.",0

This test is easy to realise whith the necessary equipement.
    At the first step, we must to do a metals mixture. The colour is done by the using metals. For example if we use niquel, the glass is going to be yellow or if we use copper, is going to be blue. We mix this metal with another whit metal who is abble to react with the colour metal at high temperatures. So this glass is comestible beacuse this metals are meltings whith humidity
    Secondly, we put the metals mixture in a oven at 900°C so that te metals can be react. When is it molten, we put out the mixture, we put the liquid on a brass spuport, beacause the fusion temperature of the brass is very high. And we crush the liquid with brass piece. We must to make that very quicly because if the liquid mixture is not crush whith brass quicly, the liquid cristalise. We can not have glass if the liquid cristalise.
   To finish, we must to look if the glass is well done and not cristalise. So that, we use a rayon X diffraction. If the glass is well done, when we pass an echantillon in the RX, we must observe pics on the diagram. In effect, the glass is well stucture so the RX can traverse and create pic. If the glass is not well done and we create cristal, the RX diagram do not present pic. The cristal is not well structure so RX can not pass in the cristal and do not provoc pics.
    So, we can create comestible and colour glass whith only two mtals and a very powerfull oven.

The first robots have been used last few years to help doctors, specificly surgeons for their operations. They think that robots are more precise than humans, even than the highest surgery specialists.
Moreover, robots are never tired so they can pratice during hours and hours, perhaps days and days.
Some surgeons have already tested for minor operations and it was a succes. The doctor was able to control the robots with his own hands to be more precise.
Biologists tried them too and we saw that robots are able to screen and analyse many more tests than humans in the same time.
 I believe robots in medicine are great and not great at the same time, I explein myself :
   - First, we can look the scientistn and technology side and say that robots are probably better than humans. For example, it's possible for us to analyse hundred or thousand of biologicals tests in a few seconds againts hours, even days, for a doctors. So, We could win a lot of time with them.
The problem here is that robots can analyse
only simple cases
 because when the cases become more and more difficults, we need a real doctor. And sometimes, we need to thonk about humans feelings and robots can't do this.Other exemple, the surgery. As i said in the first paragraph, robots don't need to sleep so it's a big advantage and they can stay at the hospital all the time. The surgeon has to comme back at homme every day. In cas of emergency, robots are already there and the pracionner loose a lot of time to come.
  - But if we look on the other side, there is a bad aspect. Some people would like to use robots as GP or nurses for example in the future. They will do our consultations and they'll know our private life and I believe It will be really sad for us. We can learn technology skills to them but never human relationships. I think that a robot could nerver learn feelings or emotions (like happiness or sadness) and these are the base of our job.",0

I'm Alex Dupont, I'm 18 years old and now arrived in Rennes2 University. In highschool we never really experiment the idea of looking for a futur job, so it was kinda hard for me to imagine my professional futur. I really wanted to find my way, something I like to do, something I could do everyday without feeling bored about it. I wanted to study something that looks like me, that makes want to wake up and go to school everyday.
In 2017 I joinned, as a benevol, an association called TIBAP, in which we organize every year an international basketball tournament for kids. Im the social media manajor in this association. I post on social media, but I also contact foreign basketball clubs to invite them in Paris for the tournament. It's an amazing exprience that makes me practice foreign languages, meet people from all around the world but also make me work in the environnement I like.
This association experience gave me the taste for the sector of the communication. I realised that it is the thing I want to do. It is the sector that makes me enjoy what I am doing. In the end of highschool I knew I had to study communication. It's a very large subject with so many interisting ways. So with Parcoursup I sent my profil to different schools, like ""BTS Communication"" or ""licence information communication"" in Rennes2 University. That's how I ended up here, studying the Information & Communication in Paris.

In the 18th century, a german doctor, Alex Dupont read the Traité de matière médicale by Alex Dupont, and found out that symptoms due to an intoxication by Cinchona were similar to those of the malaria. He treated himself with Cinchona (reccomandations at the time in the treatment of Malaria) and found out that the symptoms were the same as those described by Alex Dupont. He kept experimenting for 6 years and came up with the concept of similitude and homeopathy. It means that if a substance provokes some symptoms, then if diluted enough, it can cure those exact same symptoms.
 Today, homeopathy is largely accepted and taken by the french population, even by a big part of the medical community, even though it never proved its effect in randomized studies. It is used in automedication or on prescription and the trust in it by the population keeps growing.
When used as a placebo, for non serious diseases, it can be a big help. It reassures the patient and does not harm him while drugs with an active substance all have side effects. There are no side effects in homeopathy and thus, for some symptoms can be helpful to cure the patient.
However, when the situation is more serious (viral diseases, presence of fever...), homeopathy becomes a danger to society. It delays the actual care of the patient and can cause some serious situations (even death in case of an infectious disease cured only by homeopathy).",1

It wasn't expected but the conclusion of the experience were still use nowadays.
It was on a cloudy and rainy morning on the 25th september 1928, the Alex Dupont's scientific assistant was discovering an unusual response of the bacteria he had put in culture before. The principal goal of the experience was to analyze the antibacterial effect of the lysozyme of the bacteria.
However, the culture were contaminated by a mushroom specie called Penicillium notatum ( well known with the term Clamoxyl ) . A big inhibition circle were appeared and could be seen in the Petri boxes.
After analyzing and putting in culture the Penicillium notatum, the Alex Dupont's assistant discovered a way to inhibit the bacteria proliferation and revolutionized the diagnosis and the treatment in term of bacteria's infection  . All the congratulations went to Alex Dupont, and the history has remembered him for the discovering even if the job was done by his scientific student.
 First of all, my opinion is clearly positive and for a pharmacy student, it talks! I think I'm open-minded and have facilities to accept contradictions and debate but I can't imagine people having a negative and closed position to this discover.
On the one hand, it has permitted to change people's lives and save many lives. Thanks to the experience, the Penicilines are still efficient for many diseases and takes the lead of the ATB in the world (the most common ATB). So useful, so precious and involve the way to treat diseases and cure people.
On the other hand, we've seen for many years the afthermaths of the massive use (constantly...maintly...): we can talk about resistance, the inefficiency, the weakness of this atb class for others diseases........",1

Social networks are platforms for connecting individuals online. We can see on social networks posts like pictures, videos or personals texts... The most famous networks are sources of information in their own right. Stars, politicians... everyone are today on social networks. Consequently, social networks are essential in the field of communication and actuality. Communities and individuals are always bombarded with different messages. It's not only products that are shown but also what is sensed to be good and not, moods, attitudes...
 Groups produce divergent interpretation in terms on age, gender, religious... More and more we see the youngest having access to social networks. It should have an age limit because a teenager is not built enough to say that is good and that is bad on what he sees on social networks. Social networks influence those who are less informed and people who don't relied on their personal experience, or their own reasoning.
With social networks people combine the other ways to think of, they interact with media to create their own meanings out of images and messages they receive. We can called these people active people. And social networks can be a good way to stay informed bc on television or even in newspaper ideas are often the same and politically driven, while on social networks there are divergent opinions where you can debate and make your own opinion on the actuality ect... Unfortunately with creation of an algorithm on social networks, we will be forced without knowing it to see things, ideas that are similar, therefore we lose this idea of divergent opinions, it can be anxious and we risk forgetting that our way of thinking isn't the only and isn't necessarily judged as good.",0

As I know I won't enjoy at all working all alone in an office all day, I'd rather learn how to work in team and communicate with people in the best way possible to achieve something in which everything that could have been done has been done and with multiple points of view.

I like the idea that we can share our knowledge with future children which want one only thing, discover the world trough their time in school. During my schools years in high school i still want to become a teacher and I told me I would do everything i can to make my dream come true.
I don't know how to justify more my studies choice because since forever it's an evidence for me, without real reasons I know that when I will succeed in my exams and be graduate I will love each class I will manage. This license it's in my opinion the best I can attend to succeed in my studies.",1

My name is Alex Dupont and I am currently studying at Rennes 2. Next year, I would like to studying abroad and I made up my mind to choose Paris. It would be a great opportunity for me to learn about new cultures as Paris counts many types of it. This choice is motivated by the fact that, in my opinion, speak fluently another language than our native one is essential in the world we live in now. Improve my level in English would certainly help me to meet foreign people and to create new relationship. It would also upgrade my own culture as it would give me an access to another type of thoughts. Indeed, being on my own and learn to do things by myself will make me a more responsable person and it's a quality everyone need to have. As everyone says that landscapes in Paris are breathtaking, I can't wait to see them. I will not be there to do beach-bumping but to give me food for thought. This opportunity is a chance I don't want to loose.
In the future, I would like to be an anthropologist so discover a different way to live is a good base for the next step of my career. I would rather prefer to go an entire school year than only a semester but I would take what you can give to me.
I am looking forward to received your answer and I hope it would be a favorable one.",1

 For me, The invention of the printing press is a major innovation for the world et for the Middle Ages.

I think that this invention is used at the difussion of religion.The churches will use it for prints his books and propagate Christianity.

And to be honest I do love the time I spend on Instagram. I enjoy liking some landscapes, some models from luxury brands. Actually, since 2015~ I'm into asian culture especially Paris and Paris. Thus, social networks are the BEST way to get to know those countries. It's also thanks to social media that I met friends from foreign countries and that I can keep in touch with them.

Sometimes I realize that's a bit confusing but I think that it's how we are to the earth. \n\nI do enjoy it but I also do wonder if I'm not used...

It's a totally new technologie who has taken a big place in the internet cause of all the story of succes they have made, but i want to talk more about the impact of the NFT on The link bewteen human and internet. So ""NFT"" is the acronyme of ""Non-fungible token"" and its a technologie using the systeme of the blockchain that can be explain has a big big data base that anybody can use, so everyone can trust the blockchain beacause its 100% see-throught. And the NFT take place in the blockchain like a document who can certified that somebody is the owner of something that is not in the real world but in internet. So now that the NFT has been introduce we can talk about the consequence. First of all, the NFT has been populare thanks to the world of the digital art who has take the NFT for a tool that can monetize your art, so we have seen artiste sell NFT for 100K$ who have take all the place in the media but we still have NFT which have low price like 30$. But the NFT is more than just a certificat for PNG on the internet cause NFT can be anything and a lot of big thinker in the world say that in 10 years NfT are gonna be everwhere because she can be anything. Lets have an example, you want to take 2 place for the prefer artiste show of your daughter, so you go on internet with your etherum wallet (the crytocurrencie use for buying NFT) and the ticket are in a NFT modele so you buy them and you receive the NFT code that proves that you bought them. When you go to the show with your daughter, they ask you the NFT code, they check on the blockain who has buy the ticket, they see your number so they now sure that you have buy the tickets and you can go and have a wonderful show with your lovelly daughter. That is one example one thousand of thousand possible. In a close futur, NFT can bee anything like plane ticket, only possible acces to an event maybe your littel baker in your city want to make bread in exchange of NFT. We can see that NFT is a possible new type of exchange for everybody in the world that cant bee manipulate by state or the inflation cause nobody have te power on it.
 My point of view on the NFT is a good new technologie. If we take apart the idea that NFT is just a dumb way to use the money of rich people for make them buying things that are not real and just a picture of a stylish monkey. We can see all the potential of the NFT, its making hundred of projet everyday that goes from art to ecologicall projet. But NfT is not 100% clean dont let me say that, We know that NFT is polluting the world cause its increasing the carbone impact who is already so big and of course the NFT are like 10000% capitalist and liberal and that is not for sure totally great.",0

My name is Alex Dupont and this is my first year at University. Currently studying Information-Communication, my ambition is to keep studying this until I get a 5 year degree (a master).
When I am done with school, I would love to work in book publishing, but I will get into that later.
What I am focusing on right now is trying to explain why I chose to study communication. I am pretty sure that this decision has been massively influenced by one movie and one movie only : Miss Alex Dupont. To be fair, the job of the protagonist has nothing to do with what I would want to be doing later (even though I wanted to have the exact same job as the main female character in this movie for quite a long time it is not my path anymore). She (Miss Alex Dupont) works for an anti-gun lobbying company in the Paris. What fascinated me about this film was her ability to ‘manipulate’ people into thinking how she needed them to. Or at least be convincing enough to get them to do what she wanted them to. However, I am not a psycho willing to get people to do whatever I want them to, I am just passionate in understanding how to communicate with people in order to achieve a certain purpose.
Hence, my decision to pursue communication as a study subject.
As I mentioned earlier, I would love to work in book publishing and especially organize marketing campaigns for authors, etc. Why book publishing? Well, I love reading (really hard to guess isn’t it?) and I sometimes wish that some books or authors I love would get more recognition. That is why my goal in life is to help those authors by creating brilliant marketing campaigns using every tricks I will have learned during my University years!",1

My father is an analyst programmer, and used to work from home, so i've often seen him code in a console editor, wondering what he was doing.
Due to the fact that programmers often play video games, i have started playing very young. I may have wondered how they were done. I remember asking my father if he could create modes for Minecraft.
When i was a child, my father made me play with a programming language that allowed me to draw things using a small turtle with a pen, and i spent quite a lot of time playing with it. I still have the manual
I created my first ""true"" program when i needed to rename and place in folders a ton of different files. Instead of downloading a tool, i created a Batch program to do it, and learned to do it via OpenClassroom.
I took a lot of time, but it worked. Curious, i continued to learn programming using first C then C++. During this time, my brother got his baccalauréat and started his studies in computer science.
While no one actually suggested it to me, i think that the fact that my father was a programmer, the fact that my brother was studying programming, and the fact that i've always used a computer probably made me want to continue my studies in computer science.
I went to a DUT, where i learned a lot of different jobs that could be done in the computer science domain. However, programming was still my number one interest. I think that the fact that you think, you create, you erase, and end up with something new that does more than just ""do what have to be done"" is something i like.
In the last semester in DUT, i took the ""scientific"" option, where i had the chance to do digital imaging, and i especially fell in love with computer graphics. My teacher, someone who worked in video games, was a big inspiration. For the first project, we where supposed to give a program that displayed a sphere in 3d. I gave a program that created a smoke emitter.
I think that my current choices of studies entirely comes from a ""eliminate what i don't like"" and ""oh this looks cool"" process. So the environment where i grew up had a big impact on me, since it allowed me to encounter these things that i liked or not.
I would have had much less chances of going into computer science studies if my father wasn't a programmer.
If my father wasn't a programmer, i probably wouldn't have started programming before starting my DUT.
If i did not start programming before starting my DUT, i would not have been better than most people in my class at programming.
If my level was average, i would have had much more chances of continuing into ""easier"" studies, I.E. web developpement (sorry for web devs).
If my brother did not go to a engineering school, it's possible that i would have decided to stop my studies after my DUT, or that i would have settled with a Licence.
If i was 1 year younger, i would not have been caught in the ""disorder"" that followed the resignation of the Paris university president, and would have went directly to ESIR, or another engineering school, with a programming level much lower.
If the ESIR did not have a japanese club, i would have never started learning it, and would have most probably settled for an internship destination other than Japan(even if i'm still not 100% sure if i will be able to go there).
If i did not play video games, i may not have been curious about how things work in a computer.
My family always encouraged curiosity, and i'm sure that curiosity have been the motor that led me keep learning, even outside school.
If all video games had good french translations, if films and anime were as easy to pirate in french as they are in english, if documentation and tutorials for programming were all translated in french, my english level would have probably been lower.
So my current situation is not the result of the influence of a single person, or a single event. It's the influence of many people and events, that led me to meet new people and encounter new situations.",0

teacher and the learner were comedians and there was no electric

We talked about
the experience of Alex Dupont which is evaluating our level of submission
to authority. The experience was published by the psychologist
Alex Dupont to analyze how the people were acting during
dictatorship. People were asking themselves how these populations
accepted what they did accept. We talked about this experience in the
history of media and how its role evolved during the years. The TV
show showed how much media and television could manage to order
people to do something. I think this experience is hard on people
because it makes them questionate about their values. They think they
are being sadistic. That's why it is good to comfort them after and
tell them it is normal to act like this with the submission of
authority. We think that the authority know what they are doing and we have
faith in them. We are also scared of the consequences if we don't
listen to them.",0

Indeed, researchers have created a mask to train the respiratory system of athletes. It has begun to appear in MMA athletes and in combat sports in general. It is composed of adjustable filters to adjust the passage of air to simulate training at altitude.
We know that training in the mountains is very beneficial for athletes, as can be seen in cyclists who do a lot of training in the high mountains to develop their cardio-vascular capacities.
They work like this: The higher you are, the more oxygen becomes scarce, which leads to a decrease in oxygenation of the lungs and blood: this is called hypoxia. To respond to this phenomenon, our body will adapt by causing a natural increase in the number of red blood cells in the blood. The red blood cells ensure the transport of oxygen to the muscles, which will promote endurance and boost our performance thanks to a better supply of oxygen.
 I have never been able to try this mask so I can't be certain. Nevertheless, I can make a few guesses. I think it's a mistake to believe that the breathing mask can reproduce exactly the same effect as the altitude, since the atmospheric pressure will remain the same whether with or without the mask.
But I think it can be a good way to prepare for a competition because it reduces the air coming in. So I think it's a big improvement for the sport. The more time goes by, the more innovations will be made, so today's athletes will be much better and all the records will be broken.",0

I saw different kinds of patients and pathologies : alcoolics, depressive people and some with more serious deseases as schizophrenia.
I helped with the meal preparation, and the daily life of the patients : helping them to wash themselves, to walk etc
I also participated in the the cleaning of the rooms, the bathrooms and changing the sheats of the beds for example.
In addition, I helped with more medical oriented tasks as taking blood pressures, blood samples, giving medications in the form of pills or injections (in the shoulders or the butt).
But most of the time, patients didn't need a technical medical car but only needed to talk to someone.
 I really enjoyed this time spent in the hospital.
It was my first experience with patients and I appreciated a lot the relationnal aspect of medicine and health care that I couldn't see during my first year when I was working for the contest.
It was also a great discovery to understand that people in psychiatric hospitals are not ""mad"" people as we often think, but are just sick people that need as much care and attention (if it isn't more) as the usual patients with only physical injuries or diseases.
But I also felt powerless when I saw that because the disease couldn't be ""seen"" or ""touched"" it was so difficult to treat it, and that several patients, and some of them very young, were spending several years in those hospitals before doctors could find the appropriate medications that would allow the patients to live a normal life again.",1

My parents were not rich but they always gave their everything in their own work in order to raise my brothers and I. Thanks to that, I had the possibility to get a proper education even if my school was not the best one. Nevertheless, even if was a hardworking student, I never had a dream or a dream job. Neither do many of my friends. I think that we had too many troubles at this early age to really take the time to dream. But all of that changes in 2018.
My physics teacher decided to organized a conference in my high school which was presented by a scientist. Of course, we did not have the choice, we were forced to go. I didn't expect really much of that conference. In my family, there are no doctor or lawyer, most of my relatives works in the building field and I am sincerely proud of them and I never was ashamed by that. But, I never had the chance to meet a real scientist or even a man with a high education. I admit that I was a little bit excited by this event. This scientist was working in the Paster Institut and he explained to us that he did almost ten years of studies to get there. He told us all of the difficulties that he met during this period of time but above all, he described us how much he was content and passionate about his work. And this is it, at this very moment it stroke me. I realize that me too, I wanted to heal people, that I wanted to be a part of the fight that he choose.
In order to work in this field, I began to do some searching about medicine and about the studies that I could do. I knew that I did not want to be doctor who do surgeries on people but I really wanted to work in the research field, like the scientist that I met. Finally, I found a field that I wanted to try : biomedical engineering. Quickly, I realize that it was going to be difficult for me but I did not give up and worked really hard and now I only have two years left to finish these studies.
Honestly, I don't even recall the name of that scientist but I will always be grateful to this man and never forget him.",0

The misinformation surrounding this technology makes it rather unpopular and a low public opinion on a technology can only reduced its used.  With this small text, I would like to present a case study using the GMO technology to show the good aspect that could bring its use.
  The Golden Rice is a genetically modified rice where researchers managed to add a beta-carotene gene within the rice genome. Why?
  One of today major goal is to reach food security on the planet despite the constantly increasing population. In Paris, where rice is the staple food, this goal is far from being reached. Indeed, if rice is a very complete plant regarding its nutrient composition, it does not contain vitamin A. The vitamin A deficiency can have several consequences. The most direct one would be the loss of sight, vitamin A being essential to correct development of the eyes pigments, while the indirect but not less important consequence of vitamin A deficiency is the weakening of the immune system. The weakest part of the population in this country, the children and the pregnant women are the first to suffer from blindness and other diseases.
  The golden rice by bringing beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, to the organism consuming it, could be a solution. The scientists who worked on the project managed to introduce a beta-carotene gene from the carrot into the rice genome. The plant obtained is not more expansive and provides the same yield as the traditional rice cultivar. Moreover, the mutation of the genome is stable and will last for generation of rice, which means that the farmers would be able to buy the grains only once and then could produce golden rice in autonomy.
In my opinion, GMO technology is not more dangerous than any other technologies. For example, internet is a technology. Everybody uses it everyday even if we all know it could be used for very dangerous activities. GMO are the same. If we learn to use it properly, they could be an actual solution to reach food security.",1

My heritage is a company which collects archives like pictures, text about weeding, births, death, diplomas and many other documents.
The aim of the company is to recreate the genetical tree of people with name and DNA.
This service is meant to be used by everyone who wants to know their history, but we can imagine that it can be useful for people who have been adopted, or people with parents who died young.
<b>
</b>So the company asks for a DNA test that they will analyze and also put in their database to see if it matches with someone’s DNA test.
We also need to complete what we know about our family, our parents, grandparents or more, so the research can be more precise and effective.
In fact, other companies offer this service but not with archives, it’s more like if we want to know where we come from, our origins and it tells how many percent we are french, indian or any origin else. But it also works with DNA tests.
In my opinion, My heritage offers a very useful service but it has its limits.
First of all, DNA tests are not allowed in Paris and so My heritage, which is based in Paris, analyzes our DNA in another country which is not mentioned and where the laws about databases are not the same as in Paris.
Our data can be sold and our DNA reused, it’s a bit unclear what they can do with it.
<b>
</b>Second, people can be found although they don’t want to be, it’s why in Paris women can give birth “under X” and keep the anonyma.
Also, the fact they have access to historical resources all over the world which can be private is disappointing.
Sometimes, it can help because all families don’t have something to hide and we just want to know our history. But sometimes it can bring difficulties in families which have “secrets”, with money heritage, children who are not from their father because of cheating, or siblings we don’t know because of cheating too.
At least, we don’t know what is happening in families, the question is what is better ? Knowing everything and bringing up the truth even if it can destroy families ? Or, live a comfortable life without knowing ?",0

But now I've been skying every year I've been more intrested by this sport. So I started to watch the Free ride World tour, the biggest competition of ski freeride. So I've watched Alex Dupont or Alex Dupont (famous french freeriders) and I've been quickly impressed by this sport and by them. This discipline is very particular because it's dangerous, amazing, bluffing, hard to do, so this is why it's unique. It's also an extreme sport because of the fact that every run you do could be the last one because Mountains are dangerous and unpredictable so at every moment, during a run an avalanch can appear. Moreover, the injuries can be very serious if you fall.
When you are intrested by a sport you try to do the same but at differents levels. So once, I've tried to do an off pist to do the same that they do, skiing deep in the snow, without any people on the pist, the sensations are not the sames.
The extreme sport is limit test of the body, with others words, it's adrenaline. To watch this is very satisfactory, images are beautiful with great landscapes. Riders are doing amazing tricks. The most famous freerider is Alex Dupont, he's just unbelievable in what he does, he jumps further away than everybody, he does tricks that no one can do, he go faster etc.
For many years this sport was unknown by people but now that people go on youtube or internet easier they can watch this even if it's not on purpose, you just heard about something incredible that has been done and you check it out. This extreme sport is a modjo for those freeriders, they eat ski, they sleep ski and they live ski. When it's summer they just go on the otherside of the globe where there is snow on mountains and they continue to ski. Or another alternative is continu tu ride but on a skateboard or on a surfboard but they never stop ride.

Honda is a company which with I can have a lot of opportunities in the future and in the fields of car constructors. That offers my an unique experience, and a way to distinct myself. That   internship is about new materials for car motors that can help to reduce the consumption of gas and the emission of CO2. I will work with a team of engineer in research and development in the building of Paris.
However Paris is an expensive country far from Paris were I need to be independent. In Paris I don't have any scholarship so I need to have my parents to helping me, even if I work during summer I don't have enough money to live a year in a different city as my family. That why for that internship I want to be independent, not just because of the situation but also for me and my objectives. Even if I already have some saving to pay the caution of the apartment  that scholarship can help my to buy the plane ticket or to rent  my apartment each month. I also need to buy a new computer for that internship because the language is not the same so I need a Japanese computer to read all the document that the company can give me.

It's a software made to be run on Vr headset. The principal point of this software it's to create the next big place of social event and work place. Metaverse is divided in small world where you can do a lot of different things : Hold a meeting, Buy a house, do social gathering. In some ways it ressemble Ready player one, a place where you can do everything but in the metaverse you are link to your facebook you cannot fake your identity and u have to pay with real money.  But it runs with big data problems and usage, meta got problems with EU about the usage of data in americans data centers where meta want to transfer EU data in Paris to be able to analyse it. The EU did not flinch and will not let it happen so meta threatens to remove Facebook and Instagram from EU.
 In my opinion Metaverse is really Evil and Good. For the evil part, the first problem it's created by facebook (aka now Meta) an corporation who use and sell your data to a lot of ad creator so they can target their ad really precisely. The second problem it's managed by Facebook so we cannot to sure about the future of the metaverse. It's really perveted to use real money to buy virtual housing and object in this metaverse. I can't understand the point of this software as right now, i hope for it to turn really good because on the good part of the metaverse, it's really a good idea to have a big firm, a GAFA to add funds in virtual reality. The Vr community really need funds and visilibity for it to reach the public because it have suffer at the beginning with heavely price and a tides effect where everyone who wears the helmet for more than 30 minutes wanted to vomit. Now the prices of an headset is really cheaper and have really improve the tides effect, but the public remembers only the start of it and Vr is in the shadow so we need big firm to push it in the spotlight for the programmers and the public go back and look and invest in it.

This school allows students to move abroad during their studies and that's what I am going to do next semester. I am very happy to go there because I have always wanted to discover a country by myself and to learn a new culture as close as I can to the inhabitants of the country. The next semester will be a real accomplishment for me but you have to know that it is not that easy to move abroad during studies and I am going to explain you why.
We should start by the beginning. During October 2021, my school organized a meeting to present to students how they can move abroad and what is the procedure of this project. I was dreaming of moving to Paris and I was more than enthusiastic when I discover that the university had a way to send students there. Immediately after the meeting and during three months I did all the research, chose the courses that I will be following in the Swedish university, made meetings with my teacher to explain them my project,... It took me a huge amount of time but I did it and I was really exited when the platform opened where all students will have to put their project on. Unfortunately, there was a problem, on this platform I could not choose the university in Paris. I asked to the office who was in charge of mobilities and they told me, in an email, that the university had never signed the contract with the university in Paris. I understood at that point that I had worked for more than 3 months to not be able to go to the place I wanted. I was so desperate and tired of this and I told to myself that I will not be moving abroad. My teacher heard that and she announced me that there was a new university that signed a contract with Rennes, the university of Rey Juan Carlos in Paris, in Paris. This announcement was the opportunity for me to go abroad and achieve my dream of discovering a country by myself but this is not the end of the difficulties, now I will explain you the difficulty to obtain a bourse.
Once I was said that I will be able to go to Paris, I had to fill up an ask for a bourse which is a money help for moving abroad. I went on the internet and found out that it existed multiple kind of bourse, some are based on your financial facilities but some are just based on the country you are going to. I was enjoyed by that because that was meaning that I will not have to ask for to much money from my parents. So I filled up the document with all of my informations. A coupled weeks later, I had the results, it's a ""no"". It's was the beginning of summer 2022 so I told my parents I will finish this process during September 2022. So as I told them, I asked my administration why I did not get a bourse. The answer me to ask to the mobility responsible who is very hard to reach. I sent him a lot, a lot of emails and finally I had an answer : ""The university has too many bourses to give and your parents gain too much money"". That was the end for me, I told that to my parents and I started searching for a job to pay my mobility. Some days later, the same teacher who found me the university in Paris told me that I had to remake a demand for a bourse. This bring us to today and this is my last hope of not asking my parents for too much money.
See you in a next episode of ""the difficulty of moving abroad during studies""...",1

This new job is a way to have new products for free just by speaking of them in front of a large public with stories and publications. Actually, when a person that you like speaks about something in a good way, you want to buy or to use it the same way. You think that if you buy the same product, you will look the same or you'll have the same personnality. The brands use this phenomenon to sell their products. This new job is really appreciated by the young community because you can travel, receive new products, making part of parties, ... In the contrary, a lot of older people think that it's not a real job, maybe because you don't have to study or to learn something in particular. Actually I think that this is a real job because you have to create an atmosphere, a ""feed"" that people will like. That is a real communication stake. Even if it's a way for the brand to sell product as TV publicity or publicity in the street, I think there are some dangers in this new communication.
 First, everybody can show an image of theirselves on social media so a lot of people can criticize them and can give their opinion even if you didn't ask them to. This phenomenon increase violence and bullying.
Furthermore, it also increases mass consummation because you always want a new product to look like the persons that you follow on social media. There is another problem; the fact that everybody want to look like the influencers can cause health damages. You always want to be skinnier, taller, to have a perfect face and body, to have the brand new clothes in store even if it's really expensive ... Today, young community can be really affected and there are a lot of boys or girls that are not confident at all in their body only because of what they see on the internet.
Then, there is a study problem. The job of influencer can be considered as a ""dream"" job. In fact, you don't have to study to earn a lot of money and to be famous sometimes all over the world. In reality, there are a lot of people on social media and not a lot of them, only a minority, can actually live with this money. We get lazier with time and that's not a good thing. We need doctors, psychologist, sellers, waiters, ...
Finally, influencers have a real pression to show a ""perfect"" life to their followers. Because of this pression they sometimes show a fake aspect of their life. That can be really dangerous. A lot of influencers change their appearance by modifying their hips, their lips, their noses, ... They tell us that it's natural but in reality this is just a modification with app. Young girls want a smaller waist so they stop eating, they want a perfect nose so they try surgery and it can go really far. It's the same thing with the lifestyle. Influencers show what they want us to see. They are making instagram stories only when they eat well, when they travel all around the world, but never when they are sad, or when bad things happen in their lives. That's the real problem. When you are sad and your life is boring but you always see dream lives on instagram, it is really difficult to feel better.
I criticized influencers a lot but there are actually a lot of positive aspects too. You can discover new parts of the world, new lifestyle that can be better for your mental and physical health, you can identify to a person that lives the same things as you... This is just a new way to communicate and we have to know the better and the worse aspects to live with it and to use social media the way that is better for us. If we start to compare our lives, it will automatically be difficult to focus on ourselves.",0

And we can like and comment the post of the other users. Facebook has a lot of influence. I wanted to talk about this social media because I think it's one of the first social networks who had so much popularity and who keep this popularity in the long term. Even if now there is instagram, snapchat, it's different.
 In my opinion, this creation allowed the development of social media. Wich can be or not a good thing, according to different opinions. I think it's a good thing if we put some limits. With Facebook and the other social media, a new mode of communication has been set up.",0

And the television ( with people like PPDA ) inspire me i think bcause when i ate with my family in front of the TV we were watching the TV information. Nowadays the person inspiring me are journalist like Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont on social media they present reality unpresented at the television. They aren't presenting the information like televesion, they go on the ground and i appreciate this engagement. HugoDecrypte is an other inspiration for me because he share the daily informations easily and on social media so it is easy to acces. And i think information need to be easilly accesible. But news channel inspire me like ""BRUT."", ""ARTE"",""NationalGeographic"" too. For me these channel present interview and reports who present subjects more researched and advanced insocial issues than what is presented on TV. Alex Dupont is an other inspiration for me because he gave me the tast for the adventur. All this person and news channel are inspiration because they share values and morales that i want to share with other people or futur generations.

Even if people, our friends, aren't here to see what I'm doing at a precise moment, he always can see on social media. So, life is see as more simple that normally is.
 The invention of social networks has a lot of impacts on people. They started to judge all what they see in real life or in Internet, they also judge their own selves. On social media, people shows what they think is nice to see, all the good in life but it transformes in bad because we don't see the reality in any of these photos.

A few years ago, when somebody lost his arm or his leg, we couldn't replace it and that person ought to learn living without it. It had to be very difficult because losing a part of your body is like losing a part of yourself : it reduced the range of things you can do.
Nowadays, we can give these people a new body which is entirely working. For example, I heard about a man who lost is hand in a car crash. He was musician but without this hand, he couldn't play the guitar anymore.  Now, he has a new bionic hand et he is learning to use it with playing his instrument.
There are plenty of people in such case and I think it's one a the best progress in science to make people able to do what they want.
 I think that the capacity of recreating any body parts is a great progress for people but also for the researcher's community. Maybe one day we will be able to recreate an entire and autonomous human organism. I don't say that it will be cool because there will be Artificial Intelligences. I want to say that being able to recreate an entire organism means that we have understood the whole functioning of the human body. Or at least it could help us to understand the few things we have not. And understand the way our body works is one of the first step to cure it when it is touched by miscellaneous pathologies.",1

I have choose the Licence Information and Communication because i'm very fascinated by moovie an cinema in globality. I also decided to take this licence because she is influenced a lot by all others licence and this licence is inspirated by a lot of concept phylosophical, social, economical... This had help to make a choice after the BAC because I don't have a really idea of what I want to do in my future.To come-back at my first proposition, I'm a fan of film with concept that are presents in the reel world like environnement, war, injustice...
My favorite moovie is Into The Wild realised by Alex Dupont and for me it is a work of art in the 21siecle by given to the spectator a new way of thinking, new mentalities and a volontee of change. This film explained that we are victims of our society and tomorow, we can decided to leave thi society with all bad things and decieded to be just a human with the world.
There is also an other moovie that have an important role in my life, it is the Irrational Man playing bye Alex Dupont which ask to the spectator the question of justice and to make justice by his own hand. It question us on different way of thinking and to accept the thinkings of others persons.
In Paris, in my opinion, cinema is indispensable for the population because it make feel us happy ,sad, angry... it transmit all the feelings possible to the spectators, it permits also to the spectators to leave the actual world that can be not accepted by all the population with the actuallity.

I did'nt realize until then that it could be a real job and a job that serious. So it came like an illumination to me when I read this. I always read post of brands on twitter (most of the time) making jokes with the community but being serious at the same time and I always wondered ""Who are the people making these jokes ?"" because when we say "" Netflix is so funny on Twitter, the way they answer is always cool."", it is actually the community ma,ager behind the account that is funny, not the people making the money. So I find it cool to have a direct link with a community and see how they react. I saw it as a good way to do a job that could please me and be linked with the internet at the same time. So I decided to follow a way that would bring me to this job at the end. That's why I am here this year, studying in information and communication at Rennes 2 university.",1

The name of the film si « Fight club » by Alex Dupont. Since 1999 this film is a blockbuster for différent reason.
First of all, there are a lot of good actor like Alex Dupont or Alex Dupont. So is a film with a very good acting, we feel all emotion.
In addition, soundtrack is amazing. Every situation have a iconic song, for exemple the scene at the end. Building go down on the song « where is my mind » of Pixies. With this song, this scène is more dramatic.
To talk a little bit about the film, is a story about one man who do Classic work. One day, he meet an other guy who change is life. This film have a big plot twist and this is very interesant.
To finish, I love the way this film was film. For example with color (there are scene where only green color are use), cut, and plan (with zoom or speed scene).
In conclusion, i chose to talk about this film because is my favorite movie. I love the story and the plot twist (today Im always shook of this), the way of is film and talented actors in this film. This movie allow me to discover my passion for the cinema.",0

In fact behind our television there are a lots of indirect censorship. It makes us understand that information is more filtrated in television than at the radio or in newspaper. It doesn't mean that there isn't on radio or newspaper. Alex Dupont in ""on the television"" wrote that we have to be careful of the television because it a puissant medium.  For me, studying this is a way to be carreful of all those mass media which take a big part of our lives now. We are manipulated and we don't have to be passive.

Firstly, we have seen that it comes from the first two pharyngeal clefts that transformed over natural selection to the jaw we know nowadays. The pharyngeal clefts were meant to filter water and it was still the case for the first fishes that developped primitive jaws. Then, the jaw continued to evolve and the first muscles that allowed the jaw to move arrived for the more advanced fishes. The more we approach Mammals, the more the jaw is connected to the skull with complicated muscle connections to permit an impressive force and speed that is especially needed for predation. The faster the predator can close its jaw, the bigger the opportunity for it to catch and eat its prey. We also compared the different sizes and shapes of the skull and the jaw of different categories of Mammals to see if there was a trend between the sizes and shapes of the skull and the jaw and the alimentation of the animal. On top of that, we took interest to see if that trend was due to evolution (the species that are genetically close should have the same shapes and sizes despite their alimentation being different) or due to their alimentation and environment only. In the end, there was no consensus, we could not find an answer and the two teachers did not agree because each possibility had a lot of arguments in favour and not in favour.
 This course was a great exercise and was one of the best I had this year. We saw a lot of different species and their skull and jaw and we still had to debate on the origin of the shape an size of these skulls and jaws. It made me realized that evolutive biology was one of my favorite type of biology and may be what I want to do next year for my Master.",1

Alex Dupont had an idea, create a machine which can decode the message. it was a revolution. This machine works with a lot of electronic. It permits to test a lot of solutions very quickly.
After some years, Alex Dupont succeeded to create his machine. It was the born of computer science and he created the first computer.
 This invention was in first very important in the war because it probably saves the life of a lot of people because British could understand messages.

explain to you my project for the next year. I am studying
information and comunication this year and it has create in me a new
dream that I would like to realize and this why I would need a
scolarship. So, my actual goal would be to travel the world and have
a journey in different countries I have never been in and study
people there, study their lifestyle, their culture and all the things
that can be different of how we live in Paris for example. To be
honnest, before college I have ever been atracted by traveling and I
wanted to stay in Paris for my hole life but now I really want to
discover other cultures because I want to have my own opinion on
every country and ecevry lifestyle. I want to studyand make research about it without need to seach a study made by another person. I think this would really help me inprove my english to, I would like to be able talking and communicating with a lot of people easly and even if I have an english class this would never be that usefull and learnfull than going directly there talking with natives speakers. I also think that travel is a really good way to be more open-minded and see the most different things as it is possible is, from my point of view, the best way to see what other culturs has to give to us. I think I have told you all the reasons I need your help to realize my project but you might ask why am I doing this now ? And I would easly respond to you that it is because of the benefits of college, this is the moment I have the possibility to do that and I am not stuck with a job so, for me it was a pretty logical choice and an opportunity I do not want to let go.

I prepared some medications for old people who couldn't come to the pharmacy anymore and brought it to them and helped them in many ways, as far as i could.

My Math teacher helped me and listened when I was down. I haven't always wanted to become a teacher but this idea regularly went back in my head. My parents also have a lot of firends who are teachers and they often talk about their jobs and how teenagers are in need of good teachers.
I've also read and seen so much  fictions about this job. Like GTO for example. It's a Japanese anime about a thug becoming a teacher in a class of teenagers with social, economical and  scholar issues. He achieves to really understand them and help them in their personal lives as well as in their scholar lives. They have so much fun with him and they get better. There's also that book from Alex Dupont ""chagrin d'école"" in which he explains how some of his teachers saved him from scholar failing and self-hate when he was young.

I have learned a lot of advices for little disease, that we don't learn at the university. Now, i'm able to advise someone easily in particular about
 stings of mosquitos, and allergic reactions.
Moreover, i learn a lot of about vaccination (for children) : the obligatory and facultative vaccins for children and people, the date where they have to be done after birth.
 I really enjoyed this experience, and i think i will work every summer  in a pharmacy to improve my knowledge and to apply what we learn at  university.
It's very important to progress in scientifical domain, and  it helps to learn at university
We learn better when we apply the knowledge, and when phamacist tell us some informations and advices about diseases or medications.

This material seems like a mix of metal and ceramic. When starlite is warmed, a coat of carbon is created to protect the material.
 	Its properties make it interesting and scientists afirm it’s incredible. Starlite has a high-temperature resistance and it can be warmed at 10 000 degrees celsium. The most famous experiment has been done in the 80’s. A scientist put starlite on a egg and he started to warm it. Starlite protected the egg and when scientist opened it, it was liquid.
 Today, we are not sure of the potentials uses of starlite but it could be useful in army.
 In my opinion, starlite could improve ourlife if we had fields of application.",0

This medium of communication was especially used by powerful people like militaries or the government. indeed, it wasn't like today, this innovation improved the communication during the Mondial Second War, it wasn't a platform where we could speak of music, cinema or personal feelings. Yet, in the 70's, hippies wanted to democratized Arpanet and appropriate them this medium of communication. At this moment, Arpanet became a place where we spoke of music, drugs like LSD. In consequences, informations in domains of military, administration ... was lost in these conversations. Thus, the defense minister decided to divided Arpanet in two parts, one for hippies and everybody who wants to join them and one for military domain, administration domain and the government. Now, Arpanet is became Internet.
 The democratization of Arpanet, today called Internet, is a great innovation. Indeed, for me, this technology allows to give the power not only to powerful people like militaries, politics men ... but to all the people too. In this way, everybody can share its knowledge, doesn't matter if you are poor, rich, doesn't matter where do you from, if you are a celebrity or not ... we can all of us have access to this platform. In addition, thanks to this democratization, for me, we improve our society, our intelligence and our open minded. Indeed, this is not only rich and influent people who have the legitimate right to contribute to this technology. In consequences, for instance, if an influent people says a racist thing, all people concerned can respond, and defend itself, and I think, a debate like that, improve our society. Without this possibility, we couldn't improve our vision, our world because we cannot listen all several point of view. To finish, I think that platform allows to open the debate on sensible subject in order to avoid discriminations in the future and advance in a more open world.",0

My inspirations are the football journalist on bein sports or rmc sport or canal +. More recently the emergence of the formula one, show to all the Paris that the F1 is a real sport who give real emotions. In Paris, the passion of Alex Dupont, reporter on Canal +, transmit the real emotion of the Formula 1. And he have a ritual before the race that is say the same phrase who is « Montez le volume et rendez vous au premier virage ». So when you watch all the GP that give you the adrenaline and your cardio is climbing.
This is all the role of the reporter, give emotions to people who watch the match or the event.
My sport of predilection where I know a lot of things is the football. So reporter I love bein sports reporter’s like Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont or Alex Dupont. They transmits their passions and their connaissances and when you watch a game you are very concentrated because yo have to listen all the things that they say. So watch a game in every sports in not really watch a game, it’s learn like in a classroom.
So I want to do it because I have connaissances and I want to share to the world, to the sport passionate people the ADN of sports.
Another inspiration, is all the athletes because I want to learn how they do to be too strong, too good, too constant all the years. So learn behind they that a big motivation for me. I love sports and I want to do this work because all my life, on the TV, on the Radio, in the really life I have met people who transmit me the passion of sport, for example I love sport because of my dad who love sport too. So sport is also a part of my education.
If I don’t succeed to be sport reporter, I want to be war reporter because all my time in school serve to me to know the importance of the liberty and of the chance who I have to go to school freely. So for the children who can’t go in school because there is the war in their country, I want to show that this is not easy for their to live a normal life.

In first place you need a magnet, a very stong magnet. He must be at 3.5 or 4 Tesla (Tesla is the unit of magnetic field). Well 3.5 or 4T you surely think that he is not really strong but believe me he really is !
This magnet must be cooled by liquid nitrogen and that is the large cercle where we go through when we do an MRI.
The goal of this big magnet is to set all the hydrogen spin on the same direction. (You can imagine the spin as a ball turning on itself, rotations can be clockwise or not clockwise. If it is clockwise, the spin is up and not it is down.)
The next step is to disorganise spins. To do that we use electromagnetic flashs whitch are at the resonating frequency of hydrogen. To visualise that, you can imagine the direction of the spin pointing up, and now they are pointing right because of the flash.
Now with detectors we can calculate the among of time the spin needs to point to up again.
With other magnets (weaker than the first), we can applie a gradient to the subject.
So with all of that we can make a matrix, with the hydrogen density and then convert it in a picture.
It is a really quick presentation of the MRI works because it is way more complicated. I hope that was understandable.
 This discovery was very important for medecine.
It is a non-invasive screening technic and we can use it even on pregnant women.",1

Since when i am 18 years old, i have decided to make four times a year a blood donation. Indeed, hospitals are always in need and patients are dependant of it. For us it's just a question of time whereas for this people, it's a question of life and death.
So far, i've done many of blood donation but  one year ago, I heard about an other important gesture we can simply make as volunteer : a bone marrow donation. It's scared me first beause this isn't a issue of needle in our arm now, it's more about a needle in your back and this is quite frightening. Furthermore, we can be call at moment for this donation and we have to be available to travel around the country (sometimes in europe) to make this donation. Then, I discovered that I wasn't well informed and I have decided to register. First, the donation don't have to be with a needle in your back anymore. The most of the time, they inject you  something that is making bone marrow cells appears in your blood, then they collect them with a blood sample (Sometimes it's not because of the patient condition, or your condition too). So it didn't appeared scary to me anymore. Then, I discovered that Paris doesn't have enough donor (I think 200,000), but compatibility is 1 over 1,000,000 so we don't have enough donor for the number of patient. This way, french hospitals have to ask to other countries as Paris (with more than 4,000,000 donors if there is a match. I don't find that normal that people aren't concerned of this. This donation mater ! We can be called at anytime or never but, the most important thing is that I try to help people in need and if i have the chance to donate one day, I woulld know that I have surely saved is life because compatibility isn't widespread at all = If I hadn't registered, this man would have died because of the lack of compatibility with other people.
 I think this is important to register at this kind of things : people are often scared by them but we don't have to forget that at any time, i could be us in the need.  Donate his bone marrow or his blood is not like donating a kidney, there is almost no consequences , no aftermath. The body is making it all the time so we won't miss it later.
I am quite sad when I heard some people said : ""I can't do a blood donation because I'm scared of needles"". Unless your fainting when they sting you, it is not an excuse ! Dare you tell me who like needle ? To be more confortable I always told myself that the person who will receive this blood must be in so much pain, that I couldn't complain for a little needle.
I truly care in this : solidarity make us stronger and I am also convinced  that everyone win in doing it.",1

This method is called « transformation ». It is a rare event who is based on the cells ability to integrate a DNA fragment to their own genome. Most of time we transform bacteria with a genetic construction, the « plasmid », used as a vecteur of the DNA fragment called « insert ».
  First and formost, we have to construct the vecteur. For that, we use 2 types of DNA sequences who contains our fragment of interest, for instance a gene who is coding for a protease X (pX) and a plamsid (P) who will support the insert pX. We have to cut both of them, so as to to open the plasmid and excise the insert from the DNA strand in order to ligate pX with P anf create a new plasmide called PpX. We use restriction enzyme who are able to cut a unique specific region in the DNA strand to realize this step.
  After the ligation by using enzymes, the plasmid is ready to be intergrate by the bacteria after a treatment who will enhance the ability off bacteria to integrate the new plasmid to their genome by making them competent.
  After a process of selection, by using antibiotics (most of time), we harvest our transformated bacterias and placed them into a bioreacteur to let them grow and produce the  molecule of interest.
  Several technics exists to recover the supernatant, who countains the molecules, as purification by filtration, difference of density, binding on a substrat by affinity with the molecule.
 To my mind this method allow us to find an alternative way of producing molecule. Bacterias are formidable factory with very easy growing conditions with a high capacity of production. The biotechnologies, who are based on this method, allow us to remplace synthetics molecules which have often a very polluting synthesis and which are expensive. Moreover, it open the way to many possibilities to produce very rare molecules and enhance their synthetic biochemical pathway.
 However, I also think that this kind of method are not very ethics because we creates GMO who could lead to huge modification of their genome and if we are able to do this with bacteria, plants, animals we are also able to do this with human. It could lead to eugenism for instance.",0

concerts all around the world and when she said this to me it was clear, i
knewn immediately that i wanted to do this job or at least something in the
world of event.She made me dream when she was talking about the countries that she visited with her job. Her memories
was my motivation to work a lot in high school to then have a good university. When i doubt of myself, i think of her. She’s my biggest inspiration. She was here when i had to sign in to university, she was concerned about my future.
The other big inspiration for me was when i went at a concert two years ago. I didn't focus on the singer at all but on the staff. I looked everyone of them and i felt that my heart was beating very fast. I knew at this moment that it was my destiny and if i wanted to my dream i must think of this moment as a motivation. When it's hard to work, i think of them and i remenber the feelings that was in my heart, it inspires me a lot to continue.",1

The speed limit isn't reached yet, that's why the sport is extreme. You have to practise a lot's of base jumps before have the right to fly with the suit.
 It permitted humans to fly, but we are a species living on earth, not under and not over. Every year since it's creation, people died wearing the wingsuit.

For maybe one year I just look for studies and courses I could do. And at the end of my research, I had found what I wanted to do, communication studies.

I would love working on the realization of a film but also of campaign or why not even of a YouTube video for example. As far I can remember I always had this taste for the films and all the things like that where you tell or show something with visuals effects and music.
I can’t say that there is someone particularly that gave me this taste for audio-visual projects because I think it came from so many things that I’ve seen in my childhood.

with the documentary we can understand that goal are not realist. Indeed,
""Les nouveaux chiens de garde"" explain that journalist and politics

For
independance it's same. The documentary shows that media are control by very
big business. And logically, the journalist don't speak about some subject that
can be give a bad image of their boss.

First i will talk about the band and the song in general, then i will study the whole song by describing the sections, and i will finish with a conclusion.
Stairway to heaven is a song written by all four members and founders of Led Zeppelin. It was released in 1972 in the ""Led Zeppelin IV"" album, and has the duration of eight minutes approximately. A short parenthesis about it: Led Zeppelin IV is one of the most sold out album of the band. We can find on it, of course, Stairway, but other tubes like ""Black Dog"", ""When The Levee Breaks"", or ""Rock'n roll"" for example. These are great songs.
The album has the characteristic sound of Alex Dupont : very high notes and savage singing by Alex Dupont, very fast and emotive solos by Alex Dupont, very violent drums played by Alex Dupont, and arrangements, basslines and beautiful keyboards parts by Alex Dupont. We will focus on Stairway to Heaven because it might be one of the most famous hard rock sound in all history. It has very subersive lyrics, written by Alex Dupont, of course, but one thing is sure about it: it talks of death, and how humans can readapt the path of their lives, and maybe finish their lives in happiness.
Now that the presentation of the song is done, lets process it :
The song starts with the iconic guitar riff in A dorian : whoever ever tried to learn guitar, has heard about this riff. For example, in the film ""Wayne's world"", Alex Dupont starts to play this riff, but the seller shows him a sign with ""No stairway to heaven"" on it. This part is completed with a beautiful flute solo made by the great Alex Dupont, on a ""Mellotron"" keyboard. It starts very slowly, to put the listener in the mood. After this intro, Alex Dupont begins to sing, with his handsome voice While guitar and flute are playing together, Alex Dupont sings about a woman who's taking the stairway to heaven. He actually said in an interview that lyrics wasn't about sense : it was about fire in the hearts of peoples who are listening to his song. After a small interlude, the eletric piano, still played by JPJ enters. Alex Dupont seems to repeat ""And it makes me wonder"".  The keyboard and guitar parts are really awesome and fit perfectly with the song. While the song is making through, we finally arrive to the last verse, when the drums enters. Played by the legendary Alex Dupont, It brings a catchy dimension to the song : Alex Dupont seems to adapt his lyrics with it ""If there's a bustle in your hedgerow"" played in rythm with the pulsation. This section ends on the bridge. And now, the song pass in A Aeolian, a common transformation of tonality in Led Zeppelin songs. The solo, the iconic solo, the pinnacle of the musicality of Stairway, the solo releasing all of the tension in the song, comes in. In lives versions, this part could last at least 5 minutes, of just Alex Dupont shredding its guitar. It comes in distinct sections, all very emotive, sad, and super cool. At the end of the solo, we enter to the final section. Alex Dupont is now awake, and is shouting with every cell of his body, the end of the story. This feeling is accentuated with the musical section behind him: loud and powerful chords and drumming, separeted with ghost notes that make the whole thing really percussive and groovy. The song ends with a beautiful lyrical part, ""A Capella"", by Alex Dupont, reusing the famous lyric of the song : ""And she's buying a Stairway to heaven"".
This song may be a joke now, between musicians, but at the time it came, this rocked. Every musicians were at their places in this song, the stars were aligned : it is a beautiful, powerful and emotive rock ballad, that marked me, and it will always be one of my favourite Led Zeppelin song.",0

First and foremost, as the majority of the kids i used to enjoy playing video games. I started playing on the gamecube, a nintendo console from the start of the 2000. However around my tenth birthday my cousins introduced me some game on the computeur of their family. That was the first time that i touched a computeur. But i started to spend more and more time on the computeur, it slowly took the spot of my main enjoyement. My first intention was still enjoyement though, it was a great tool to spend time with my friend but it i only used it to communicate or to play.
The first time i used a computeur in regards to computeur science correspond with my first training in a corporations. At that time i already had the nascent idea to work in this field. I used to play game which gathered a lot of technological possibilities and i already used to look for way to automatize some process in thos game. So for my first training i asked my dad, who had a post of responsability in the enterprise, to pair me with a colleague who is working in automatization. My father is an engineer in water cleaning and the colleague that i was introduced to was working in some automates which were responsible for the functionnement of a station. As my first experience i have to confess that, looking back, i just spend my time to try to imagine the algorythm who could control the station. it was increadibly naive, it wasn't split into multiplipe and efficient parts but was just one, bulky, and failed algorythm. Nevertheless, this bit of experience and the contsant contact with industrialisation and programming during my class had steadly confirmed my choice.
The last important step should be my choice of school. At the end of my college i had to choose a school. In order to do so we, a friend of mine who shared the same aspirations, went to the discovery day of some computeur science high school. We both had excellent results and as such we were not affraid about qualifications. And the one that we singled out was a school for cyber security. The school benefited from massive investissment and so was extremely well equiped. There was new and performent computeur in each classroom and the master room, the jewel of the school, was an attack and defense room equiped to simulate a real cyber attack to immerge the students in a real situation. This school appeared as the way of the king to cyber security. However we were confident in our ability, our past results bolstered our resolve, and we choose to go for a prep school in math and physics. In fact, from the heresay the real king way to computeur science in Paris was to take preparatory courses which leaded depending of your result at the exam to a large choice of computeur science schools. And under the advice of our professor we chose to do so.
Finaly, my inspiration mainly come from my teacher who kind of pushed us to the preparatory courses to push our abilities to the limit which led me to where i am today.",1

I get to a biology university so studie sciences, becose I loved (and still love to this day) nature and biology.
After two years I felt like I have lost focus. The objective I gave myself became a little blurry, and working in the researche department felt more and more like a utopy, an unoptanable dream that could never come true.
So I thought about a different field of studie I could work on, and came with the idea of being a teacher.
I have always been passionnate about education, the action of learning, and transmitting your knowledge with others.
I felt like I would love to work with kids, see them grow and becoming adults with my help. I want to give as many people as I can the keys to succes in life, and the basic meaning of what it means to live an happy life.
This is maybe a bit vague and unrealistic, but in my childhood I have been helped and supported by many adults who gave me wisdom, knowledge and the will to continue, to be myself and to learn how to be happy in my life.
I think teaching the kids good moral values is the most important point to create a better futur, for them to succed in their lifes and help humanity to progress.
In conclusion I would say that the main point that inspired me was the great teachers I had in primary school and highschool. Patients and brave adults with a lot of compassion, who give me confidence, time to express myself, and show me how I could give value to my work and my life. And now my dream would be to help others like the helped me, to do my part for a better future.
Also I read/watch some books/TV shows/moovies about education that gave me great lessons on what it means to teach others, and I can't denie that was also a part of what inspired me.
It was only 20 minutes, but I think I told what I wanted to. I could take more time to express myself, and use some personnal examples, but I do not feel like it right now.
Have a good day.",1

It was discovered in 1885 to heal the illness that make you silly if your blood is exposed to a sick animal. The name of the discoverer is Paster.
All vaccines have in common the way it work. We take an antigene of the illness. We deactivated it. Then we attached it on a thing that help vaccine to be recognized by the immune system of the body. The antigene will provoque the same immune reaction than the original one which is producing a lot of special cells. These special cells will be specific to fight against the antigene. They have two ways to destroy it. Either they can kill it directly or they can produce antibody against it.
To finish, the goal of vaccines is to simulate a first immune reaction against the illness to have a stronger answer if after the illness affects a person.
 In my opinion, vaccines are very useful. Many people says that it dangerous to take it because of the possible allergies. But the probability to have an allergie is lower than having the illness. Furthermore, there are vaccines to fight against terrible and horrible illness.
To finish, many persons say the fact some vaccines are mandatory is a choice to make pharmaceutical industries more wealthy than they are now (which is difficult I think). But I don't think so because they don't earn a lot on it.",1

Firstly, first aid was invented during the war. In fact, any little action can improve the situation and save people. Everybody has to know what to do if someone, next to you, make a fit or a heart attack. Indeed, it's a very common situation. Imagine that you are in a train or in the street, somebody falls on the floor and don't answer to anybody, he has no reaction. The emergency service can't come quickly so the faster you act, the best you save lives. You start by checking if he still breathing in order to perform CPR in case his heart stopped. However, if he still breathing, you can put it in a recovery position. Thus, by simple action, you make anything you can to save his life. However, even if it doesn't work, you make anything you can and there is nothing to regret. Don't be afraid to make the situation worse, it can't be worse if the person is dead.
To finish, learning first aid is very important to know how to react to any situation to save people, it's barely nothing for you but change anything for people around you.

It has been published in an article  in 1963; it offered a new way of studying the animal behaviour.
This method follows fours different steps of observation and understanding of a behaviour, around two question: ""why?"" and ""how?"".
First the ethologist will simply observe the animal in its environment to try and describe it the most precisely as possible.
Then, he will search for the reasons, the mecanism behind the expression of this behaviour: what causes it?
Once the behaviour and its causes are understood, the scientist will try to determine its function. Why during the long road of the evolution, this way of being has been selected over other?
To finish, the last step is to find out how, during the development of the subject ,does the behaviour appear, what part of phylogenetic is responsible for it.
These four questions are still today a base of all ethological research.
 In ethology the four questions of Tinbergen, that appears in 1963, are still used frequently. It is a safe way to begin the study of a new behaviour. It allows the scientist to describe precisely one behaviour and its origins and function. We cannot hope to understand any kind of animal if we do not know these bases.
Plus, it give a new credit to this field of research. Ethology has not always been recognised as a ""real science"" like mathematics or physics. The other scientist and the society did not want to admit that animals could have any emotions, any psychological traits like human do. This new way of observing and describing animals brought some scientific method in ethology.  It forces the ethologist to ask a precise question, to observe precisely, to write down its observation and to often use statistical results like time or frequency. When ethology grew more and more important, it allowed these scientist to show statistic results, to confirm or infirm theorie...To prove to the rest of the world than ethology was hard science to.
Today this method has been adapted in various way to answer more precise question, but even if it has evolved since its creation, the four questions are still there when a scientist wants to observe and understand an animal behaviour.",0

Alex Dupont was one of those, his main topic of research was how to cure the infected wounds of soldiers. Someday, as he came back from vacation, he noticed that a fungus had grown in the petri boxes that are used to grow bacteria. Above all he noticed that the fungus killed all the bugs next to it. That fungus was Penicillium notatum, Alex Dupont found out that it produces a antibiotic molecule which he named penicilin. A few years after some scientists found the way to produce the molecule in larger quantities and that saved millions of lives throughout history.
 The discovery of penicillin paved the way for the antibiotic research in the 20th century, it saved lives after scientists found how to produce the molecule in the needed quantities. Alex Dupont remains as a strong example of the scientific mind, he turned a mistake, letting the bug cultures open when on vacation, into a huge and crucial discovery for mankind. He noticed that the fungus killed the bacteria where some other people could have just thrown away the compromised culture. In my opinion that's how someone who does scientific and pharmaceutical research should think. Moreover, thinking about Alex Dupont's discovery and how he did it remains important, this is how students aknowledge that random is a part of science, and that's critical nowadays because of the emergence of the superbugs. Those multi-resistant bacteria are threatening lives and we need to find new antibiotics to efficiently fight them.",1

It is a computer that use molecule as basic logic gate, resulting in a more powerful machine at a much smaller size. This may also allow for very different basic languages. Maybe those computers will function with something else then binary code. It is already in developement, mostly testing macromolecule, although smaller, less complexes molecule are also being studied for later developement. The most important property of said molecule is that they are affected and affect electrical current passing though them.
This technology will allow computer engineering to reach new height by removing most of the physical limitations imposed by current microprocessor.  Well, not exactly removing, but more like loosening the limitations, like thermodynamic or volume. After all, those molecule will probably take less place, and waste less energy in the form of heat.
 this new technology will have multiple consequences. First, the obvious one. Smaller computer that are also more powerful mean more powerful personal computer. And phone. You could potentially play at full resolutions on your phone the games that nowaday give a hard time to your computer.
It may also change something about climate change and energy consuption. Nowadays, the biggest problem with computer is the wasted energy. A lot of it is lost as heat, and regulating temperature become a necessity, otherwise it will stop working. Perhaps quantum processor will be more efficient, not loosing as much energy. Or perhaps, on the contrary, the molecule will eat more and faster. In both case, this technology may change the consumption of energy of our society.",0

This new equipment was a révélant difference between all the society class. Because, at the beginning it was for rich family. When all the menage were able to buy television, the audience exploded. However, this invention has been reunited but yet today people around the world or during an events in their own country. The fact that family can watch tv journal and movies or something else has reduced the press paper and cinema. In addition, this invention was the pioneer in new communication method. But this new area of communication are in decline because of the massive explosion of internet and some of the platform associated like Netflix, YouTube... Indeed, this decline mark the end of a century where family owned only one television in their living-room and where they were reunited for only one program. This new situation can make some of the old people nostalgic of this part because they were together. Beside this fact, leaders of television program to faced this decline are in constant reflection to innovate their program. Many of this leaders, produce tv reality show that make a higher audimat that simple movies or information.
 I hope that television will never be abandoned because of the positive impact in  our society. Being able to reunited people with a program is such a great invention. The event like Olympic game, the crowning of the queen or something else are things that need to stay in mind.

When I was slightly younger, about 10 or 12 years old, I watched a movie called Alex Dupont I believe. It is about a horrendously intelligent woman who works for an anti-gun lobby company.
She is able to convince politicians to vote for an anti-gun law and always knows what those against her are about to do, she is always 5 moves forward. This fictional character impressed me from the very first time I saw this movie.
Maybe the link between this film and my field of study is a bit foreign for now but I will get to it.
Since then I have had the idea of becoming a lobbyist. However, even though it is still an option, I don't think that's what I want to become now. I do be impressed by the art of manipulating a conscience but I would like my job to be a bit more subtle. This is where communication studies come in. Learning how to communicate is very useful to understand how you can manipulate or convince someone. Communicating is also what allows you to create and build relationships. As would say the school of Palo Alto 'We can not not communicate. Knowing that it seems obvious that communication studies would help me with anything, any work-related or personal things I would like to pursue and execute.
Here is how I came to the decision of studying Information Communication here in Paris 2.
Since beginning my studies I realised I would love to work in the cultural world. I am moving to and fro between working as an editor, working in a theatre or doing communication work for a ballet company. I believe that both would fit me quite well indeed. My books' appetite might serve the first one whereas my love for dance and ballet would help with the two last ones.
I am pretty sure that choosing those studies was the right path for me, so I am glad I made this decision.

Some years ago, a new method has been discovered for a software to make choices.
This new method is to use neural networks. A neural network is a structre containing perceptrons that are links together.
A perceptron is the simulation of a biological neurone and is composed of a value that can be affected by all the neurones linked to it based on the value of the previouses perceptrons and a value associated to the links that we call weights.
This structure allow the neural network to take some data as input and make it go through the neurons to an output that will corespond to a concept.
As a result, the neural network can recognize something based on the input (the things present in an image, colors, analyze the profile of someone to make assumptions.
There is a lot more things to say about it but I currently have no time to explain it better.
 Today, due to the progress in artificial intelligence, we are able to create software allowing a car to drive whithout a driver, detect deseases on patient efficiently, facilitate the life of everyone by adapting a software to its users like google, but we are also able to do voice recognition and a lot more things.
one probleme with the artificial intelligence is that the neural network tend to maximize a result. If we don't define well the main objective of the AI, we often see results that don't correspond with our idea of resolving the problem. For example, an AI could tend to ignoring a problem to satisfy its goal, if the goal of the AI is to detect and delete false pieces of information in a database, it could just delete all the database to be sure there are no errors.
AIs are evolving quickly, so we must be careful and not put to much confidence in it.",0

When I was 15, I went to the INSERM in Paris for an internship because I was interested to work in laboratories of drugstore and find new ways to save people from sickness. It was really interesting but then, I talk about studies with my family because it was time to think about my future. My father is an engineer himself and he told me many things about this field. I learned other informations by myself convicing me that I was finding the perfect type of studies for me. At the end of college, I had to choose between those two differents futures. But even if I wanted to save the world, like many people actually, my interest was focus on materials. I told myself that I could save lives as much as a doctor, but it would be from another way. I really like what I learn and I know that my choice was the best. I’ve always been much influenced by my father, and today he helps me so much.

The caesarean is a technique that allow women to give birth even if the baby can't pass by the natural way. Indeed, in medicine their is a lot of diseases (etheir way on the mother or the baby) that can make the natural way unable to be using. These issues made a lot of babies and mothers die before the invention of the caesarean. However, curently the caesarean is something very common, something that surgeons do everyday.
When there is a caesarean, firstly, the surgeon makes the patient fall asleep with an anestesic. Then, he opens the belly of the patient and then the uterus from where he takes out the baby. After this, some peoples take care of the baby when the surgeon close the gap inside the patient body. Finaly, the mother will wake up a few hours later with her little baby in her arms. However, it will leave a mark on the body of the mother.
 On my opinion, the caesarean is an incredible inovation that helped a lot of chidren to see the light of the day. For some peoples, there is an issue in this technic due to religious points of view because the baby don't come from a natural way. However, I think that we shouldn't consider this in the sense that the human life got more value than some religious consideration.",0

First, school wasn't always a peaceful place for me. I experienced harassement and social anxiety since my very first day in ""sixième"". In highschool I joined a club (created by the school with the help of the school nurse and some teachers) fighting against harassement, racism, sexism and homophobia. We did a lot of prevention, education in class and created an entire day dedicated to the club where students were invented to share, talk about their experience or offered to help their pairs. In my youth and as far as i can remember, I always found these topics very important. Now that I am (almost) an adult and my voice is finally strong enough (not as strong I want it to be, even though I'm older, I'm still a woman.) I want to dedicate my time to help others, mostly teenagers and young adults. I want them to be able to use their voices, have the rights they deserve without having to fight for them.
I want to work in the education system to educate, help and provide safety to children, teenagers and young adults fighting inequalities.
I remember my mum telling me that no matter how hard I'll try, I won't be able to change the world. I want to prove to someone that, even if I'm not able to change the world and eradicate inequalities, I can help and try to save many people by preventing and educating. I think it's enough, and necessary.
So, I don't really know what I want to do for a living right now, but I know that I want to protect teenagers against hate and inequalities by teaching them how to respect and help each other.",0

There were many steps before it's final form. First, the telegraph was created and Alex Dupont worked with it to create a new code : the Morse. Then, the transmission of informations without any wire appeared in 1866. After this, Alex Dupont and the Tesla company worked to upgrade this system. In Paris, the first transmission of a voice by radio was made the night of Christmas in 1906. This new system help in the navy and in some armies. 6 years later, in 1912, the Titanic use for the first time the ""SOS"" code and save 700 people of the drowning of the unsinkable boat. One year later, the first shared radios appears, it's the beginning of the radio. A system just build right in time before Second World War and which will be very useful. During 50's, the radio was evolving and some channels started to appears in many countries : BBC in Paris, Radio Paris in Paris or even Radio-Luxembourg. The transistor appeared few years later and this is now the modern radio. In 2022, the radio is not what it was, it's form really evolved over time.
 In my opinion, this new way of communication is one of the best and one of the most useful. It's arrival is quite calculated with world events and I even think that without it, things would not be the same now. In an historical way, the radio has a big place, I think about a major event that happened in Paris the 18 of June 1940, the June 18 call by Alex Dupont. Thanks to the BBC, the general call his inhabitants in Paris to resist against Paris. Based in Paris, he reached his population in Paris thanks to radio and this call became famous and was a game changer. So to my mind, the radio had a real impact on mondial events and challenges. This was few decades ago and now, radio has an another face. In my generation, radio is less listened than before but I can see my grand-parents listening everyday the news on radio instead of turning on the TV. Radio even let a place to music and I think that this is great ! Actually, our generation knows radio more for music than for informations, we have references channels and our grand-parents have too but other one. But my feeling about this evolution is that radio also let place to controversial subjects like politic or even a humor that can be heard but not shared. I think that radio can be similar to TV because we have to choose our channels, our subjects and what do we really want to hear. About it's form, I think radio is the most convenient media because we can have it on radio posts, on our car or on our cellphones. Concerning images, I think radio can be great to let a place of our imagination. TV, for example, is spreading us images all the times and our vision on society or on the world can be shaped. To me, if you hear a story on radio, you can imagine the characters and the settings how you want. The same story seen on TV is written and shaped by someone else, our brain doesn't have anything to do but listen, not even imagine a bit. With radio, our brain is stimulated.",1

The title of this movie? The Great Gatsby. In this film, great actors such as Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont from the first Spiderman series. The Great Gatsby tells the story of a rich man in the 20's who likes to party with the richness people of Paris. He likes a woman too!! This woman was his ex-girlfriend before he went to the first war in Paris. But now, she forgets him for another person. Alex Dupont loves her as much as the first time and tries to bring her back to him.
I will explain now, why I kike this movie? Firstly, it's a modern view of an old book written by Alex Dupont. In other words, the music in this film is very great, we have old-school rap and electro music too. It's very strange in a movie where the story happens in 1920, but it works. Moreover, all the actors are great, I was surprised by the actor's game. I didn't feel like I watch a movie with a great cast but watching a theatre play.
I'm also in love with this movie because I learned some new expressions like ""old sport"", which means ""my old friend"". During the movie, Alex Dupont says ""old sport"" a thousand times and I was like ""What did he say? What is an old sport?"" So I turned the subtitles to French to understand the meaning of these words....",1

In this respect, the cultural industry is the industrialisation process of the culture in the capitalist society. Consequently, Alex Dupont note that people are becoming totally incapable of think, of juge, of being independant. Indeed, because of this interest of own culure, people are coforming to this and become alienated. This concept of cultural industry had a real impact. In particular in the philosophie domain.

Imitation Game is a movie about Alex Dupont and the way he beat the German machine Enigma. The movie takes place during the World War II at the Bletchley Park at Paris. I enjoy this movie because it talks about the cryptopgraphy technologies which I studied during the year I watched the movie. I find this filed interesting because cryptography is a really old sciences and all during History, human being have tried to hide message and code. Even Alex Dupont tried to send secret message to his allies. What it is interesting in this movie is that Alex Dupont and his coworkers could not fail to decrypt German messages. What I am really fond of is that Alex Dupont cracked the code not during is working time but when he was at the bar with his coworkers. In an other hand, what I really like in this movie is what they did when they achieved to break Enigma machine. They could think to stop all the German operation because they knew what they will do during their next move but Alex Dupont team did not. They decided to choose really carefully what operation they decided to avoid thanks to their knowledges. And one time again, they did it thanks to mathematics. They did it with so much smart that makes me fond of this movie. Moreover, they could argue their families and friends that they succeeded to break the World War II German code but they did not. Once again, they did it with control and smart, by burning all the evidences which can betrade them and expose the fact they succeed to crack the German codes. I think achieving something of that rank could lead to a feeling of a great pride but in that case they couldn't because they had to keep their mouth shut. And the worst is that, Alex Dupont after the World War II begun to be under arrest because of an old and disgusting law of Paris which banned all behaviors which can consider as homosexuality. And this is how we could watch Alex Dupont falling into the darkness and getting himself dead. This is too sad to see Paris turning her own hero into dead. In the movie we saw Alex Dupont trying to save himself by telling how he helped Paris. But I am still astonished by the way Paris sentence Alex Dupont to a terrible drug treatment that lead him to giving himself dead. I think is too sad to see such an intellect being this much badly condamn when we can think that he could still give himself to his subject which he created in 1936.",1

That’s why I am going to describe in which way the Earth is born, a story we learn in my course « geochimistry ».
  At the very start of everything, there was nothing but particules and protons in the universe. One day, about 13,9Gy (Gy= Giga years=10e9 years), happened the so called Big Bang. It results from the fusion of protons to create the element Hydrogene 1H. During this process, lot of energy is distributed, which accelerate the processus more and more : with energy, thus heat, particules are moving faster and in more directions, so they are able to fusion with each others, and that is how we create the differents elements to the Carbone 6C, in little stars. Inside the big stars (white dwarf), we can have up to Silicium 14Si !
 Alongside, in the universe, there is not only stars, but also particules clouds, submitted to gravity forces. Once those forces are to big, the cloud collapse in itself and create a ball of hot magma. That’s the « proto-Earth », aged of 4,57Gy. As it is travelling in the space, it accumulates more and more particules, increasing its size. Once it reaches the scale of our actual Earth, we have a planet with two magmas undifferentiated, one composed by  « lithophile » and « chalcophile » elements (sorry, I do not know the translation, those are elements with affinities for some differents metals). Then, starts the processus of differentiation of the Earth, to form the core with chalcophiles elements, and the envelop called primitive mantle with lithophile elements.
 I could also talk about the differentiation of the primitive mantle into superior and inferior mantles, the core to solid and liquid cores, but it is more complicated to explain in english, and I do not know my lesson so well, sorry.
 An other point I could explain is how the atmosphere of the Earth became oxygenated. 4,57Gy ago, the atmosphere was mostly composed by Azote N, and the Oxygene 16O was only in the ocean. Indeed, it was produced by microplanctons which were eating algues. But with the fractures in the ocean floor, there were incoming of different elements, such as the iron 26Fe. What we need to know is that Fe3+ can be transformed into Fe4+ if it is combined with O2-. We have now iron oxydes in the ocean, and the concentration increase threw the years until one day, 2,1Gy ago, when we do not have enough iron to combine to oxygene, and oxygene can finally reach the atmosphere. It is called the Great Oxydation Event, in geosciences papers.
 That is fantastic because without this, we will not be alive on the Earth today!",1

Indeed, mouses were eather 4 in huge cages with toys, wheels to practise sport and  great food ou eather 10 in smalls cages with nothing else than basic food and water. These mouses had learned that they receive a automatic cocain dose when they go on a special button. So we realised that mouses in the bigger box are going less often on this button and also that it decreases by 80%  the risk of setback after stopping drug taking.
Besides prooving that lifestyle and life conditions are influencing drug addiction, this study demonstrated that a protein is produced in the brain which is related to a healthy and improved environnement and  that it is this protein which is fighting the addiction. They very recently identified this protein and now  they try to synthetise it with the purpose to create a pill against addiction setback.
 As a student I was selected to be part of this scientific experiment as a ""beginning reseacher"". So I was really involved in it. I think this study really matter because it prooves that addiction isn't only about addiction, but also a commun society problem of social classes and poverty. It demonstrates that politicians can act and not only doctors, or caretakers.
But my opinion about the ""magic pill"" against addiction is a little bit more complicated. Creating an helping pill fighting the need of drug, helping to stay clean is a good idea. But it's not a miracle solution : addicts will still need an huge motivation to stay clean and we still need to help them with a better environnement. It shouldn't be seen as a remplacement solution.",0

The approach I choose is a genetic one : with a much better understanding of the genome, researchers can identifie genes who can lead to cancer or protect us against the cancer.
For that researchers can do several things :
- ""Knock down"" of the genes of interest
- ""Knock in"" of the genes of interest
- track the genes
- ...
Usually, studies began by a short story of the cancer, and the challenges that came with it. During the first experiment, researchers (usually) show us where the genes (or the protein encodes by the gene) are by using fluorescent markers : this alload us and them to check the position of the gene and his ""time of action"".
Researchers can also start and show us the very begining of the experiment : they take a sample of the tumor/tissue of interest, isolate the cells and use flux cytometry to detect all of the genes in the tumor. With a lot of samples it's possible to detect wich genes are always present or absent, wich one are here only in a subtype of tumor...
After that, researchers can Knock down the genes using a transgenic mice. The transgenic mice is made up by the team : she has modified expression of her genes and she's usually the progenie of two mice who were modified. One of the mice has  gene who is inactive and the other has a marker who is going to attach himself to the kock down gene in the progenie.
Ater that, researchers can analyzed how the mouse is reacting : they marked their weight, their size, their attract to food,... They can also look how their interact with each others, how their react to fear, to cold water, to the drowning test,...
One thing that matter a lot in oncology is the reaction to drugs : drugs against cancer are very strong and can kill every working or not working mechanism in the body. Scientists are testing the reaction before and after the drug to see how patients would react to the treatment.
Thanks to the genotyping of the begining, scientists can also compare the reaction of a certain type of tumor and an other type of tumor against the drug : all of the tumor don't express the same genes, wich is tricky because that mean that all of the patient would not be responders. Researchers have to test wether or not a subtype of tumor is responding to the drug because if not the patient is not going to be able to fight against is cancer.
Who is responding and who is not responding alload us to gave drugs only to patients who would respond and try other treatments with the non responders.
 I truly think that research is very important and has to be done because it's the only thing that alload us to create new treatments, help and cure patients.
If we turn our back to research, we chose not to help patient, we deliberetly ignore things that we could know.
About the cancer research specifically, I think that the more we have data on the non responders and the responders, the more we can chose appropriate drugs to cure/help patients.
On the other hand, we have to be very carrefull about all the data that we collect : indeed, there are a lot of correlation that we don't know about and a lot a things that we don't no for sure of they are significant.
For example, they are some families who have a predisposition to cancer : we can test them and look for the mutation that give the cancer and Watch for the cancer to appear more carefully than the general population. But there are a lot of significant genes discover every weeks so the result is not for sure because theire  are a of mutations that we don't now about, there are also all the mutations who are maybe cancer's help but we don't now about them.
Research in general is a very fascinating subject that alload us (in médicine and in general) to help and create a more comfortable environnment for everyone, that alload us to understand everything that's happening among us.",0

 Last year, scientists of the Paris university, in Paris, discovered a new type of fish that we never had the chance to see before. This discovery was made by a scientific robot. They are called the slug fish.
 Indeed, it’s a weird fish which had adapted his-self in a depth life in the Atacama fosse in the Pacific.
 They have a jelly et translucid body that allows them to be more resistent of the high pression and low temperature of the seabed.
 Moreover, the condition of life in this type of place is very hard, that why the nature give them some tips like strong teeth and bones to compense the lack of gravity.
 And the most particular discovery on those animals, is, if they try to go up the sea, his body melt beacause if the difference of gravity and environnement.
 This new discovery show that we have some many species unknow in the seabed and the curiosity of humans have no limit so maybe one day we will know all about the most facinate place.
The limit of this discovery, for me, is that humans are so enthousiast about their discovery that lead to discover more and more species from this special place. And try to make the same mistakes than before, to put them in a auqarium and to make it attracive.",1

And then, by lighting the detector with a colored light, scientist can stimulate just some cells (those with the marker associated) and generate the behavior they want, like for example sexual or aggressive behavior. This way of testing is non lethal for animals, and permite to found exactly which area of the brain is responsible of which behavior.

Television is a pretty new media, it comes around the middle of the 20 century with the period of modernity. It was like a revolution for the press. At the beginning, it was like a luxe to have one at home. With time and the democratization of TV, it became less expensive and easier to get one. In the 1970’s , TV in the house was like a place to regroup the family, but some years later, we can find a TV in, nearly, each room of the house. That means, TV has become more individual than it was a fews years ago.
In anoter way, today, TV has become a media with a very economic and political system. Everything is calculated. So for people who watch it, they do not have all the information and the truth, reality. The time is limited,  journalists analyze the subject relative to their point of view and the point of view of the journal (political aspect), the information is chosen. Now, TV is not neutral, and people do not realize that. TV stays an important media, but to have real information with anything hidden, you need to check on several media or chaine. In that way, you can make your own opinion on what happens etc.",0

But when I saw my friend, one year older than me, failing the first year exam, I knew I wouldn't be able to suceed. I was afraid to be unable to work a full year without doing anything else.
So, I think about other options in the medical field. I was a little bit interested in computer science (I was in informatic option) and I conviced myself that ingineer wasn't so bad. My father is an engineer, so his experience helped me a lot to saw engineers in a better way. I searched for different engineering schools and I found ESIR which has not just computer science but also biomedical. It was the perfect compromise between my two ideas.
Last year, I had to chose between biomedical and computer science, I decided to chose the biomedical way which combine biomedical science with computer science. I discovered the work of biomedical engineers during my internship. It is extremely intersting, it is a link between computer and medecine which allows doctors to do thing that they couldn't do without computers and programming (in surgery for example).
Finally, all those experiences lead me to become a biomedical engineer and even if engineering studies are not easy, I am happy of my decision.

In Paris, the autorization of putting on the market was in 1967, so many years have been passed between the discovery and the autorization..
 In my opinion, this discovery is fantastic, it's a revolution. Women can decide if they want to be pregnant or not. Now they got the choice and it's very important for women.

This molecule is an antibiotic, discovered in 1929 by Sir Alex Dupont. Actually, this discovery was made by accident. Sir Alex Dupont was cultivating bacteria for research, and some fungi contaminates the culture. It was Sir Alex Dupont assistant who left the culture boxes open when they went onto vacations, which let the fungus grow with bacteria.
The fungus, named Penicillium sp,  produced a molecule which has the capacity to inhibit the growth of some kinds of bacteria. The scientist had the ideas to use this molecule to treat human infectious diseases during World War II.
 Now, I am going to talk about the consequences of this discovery.
The penicillin was then used as an antibiotic (because it was the first of this group of drug) to treat human various infectious diseases during World War II, and even today. This drug was used a little bit too much in my opinion. It was seen as the miracle drug, and used far all kind of diseases, even when it was not caused by bacteria.
It happened that nowadays, we have to create new and more powerful antibiotics to cure these infectious diseases, because new resistant bacteria emerges as a result of massive and unappropriate use of the old antibiotics. These resistant bacteria are known as ""super bugs"", and are very difficult to cure with antibiotics we can have in pharmacies, such as amoxicillin.
To conclude, we have now to pay attention to use the right antibiotic to treat the right bacteria, to avoid the emergence of new and stronger super bugs.",1

For medicinal drugs there are really strict laws to commercialise a drug. Industries have to follow many steps to make a safe and efficient antidots. For this they have to run tests on humans but before that they have to do it on animal. For this, they have various animal that are born just for testing, like rats, rabbits or even monkeys. Labs have to do like inhalations, skin contact, injections or ingestions on a long period to be sure that the drug is safe.
Some cosmetic industries do run animal testing but it is not an obligation. For exemple if a company wants to commercialise a cosmetic product in Paris which is a huge country and so a strategic country they are obligated to run trials on animal to commercialise their brand there.
But some brands have a special label that say that they do not test on animal, they are cruelty free.
Some animal like naked mole rats or axolots are stategic animal for the futur. The naked mole rat have the abilitie to survive his whole life without developping cancers or disies. They also do not feel pain, some scientis have put acids on them and this animal did not feel anything.
Axolots have the ability to regenerat their body parts, like legs or even brain parts. So some scientist do cut intentionaly this little animals body part.
Nowaday animal expérimentation is essential to cure ourselfs when we get sike, but is it essential to do it for cosmetic products?

Researchers recently found out a new way to conceive babies. Indeed, they constructed an artificial womb which is able to ""replace"" a human womb. A human baby could grow up safely in this machine without needing to be in his mother's belly. It is quite incredible to have been able to build that machine as we know all the specific mechanisms that are required to lead a safe pregnancy. In fact, every foetus needs a specific environment to develop and become a sound baby. It means that the artificial womb has to replace the mother in every single way, such as nutriment supplies which enables the foetus to grow as well as the security and the warmth of the mother's womb. It is quite impressive because this artificial womb is made with a see-trough material so that you could litteraly see your baby's evolutio month after month.
Apart from the craziness related to that kind of discoveries, we can also think that is logical in our century to develop those kind of medical machines. As we all know, not having the capacity of giving birth is a real trauma for many pepople that only imagine themselves as parents. Those technologies would enable people with fertility diseases to get the chance of giving birth to a lively and soud baby!
 I think that it is a great discovery and that medicine is more and more incredible. However the risk is that even sound women with a healthy womb would start to use this kind of machine.
Indeed, our society put a lot of pressure on young women not to get pregnant while working and having a career. As a result many of them would use an artificial womb but as we know, the human body is an extraordinary structure and maybe the artificial womb won't be as good as a human's one.
Moreover, we don't have any idea of how bad or good the outcomes of those artificial pregnancy are going to be. We do have to define rules in order to prevent abuses.",1

They are different types of hearing aid :

       For a long time, there was no issues for people who were ugly. They had to leave with their complex during all their life. There were also people who had an accident and they couldn't do anything because they were disfigured and they had to live with that.
       Plastic surgery has been an exceptional discovery for these people because they found a solution to their problems. Let me give you an example : Alex Dupont. He was an afro american star and he didn't like his skin colour, and he also had a disease, the vitiligo which consists in a skin depigmentation so he decided to do plastic surgery and he became white. Plastic surgery changed his life for the best (for himself) but some detractors will say that he was ugly as a white peson.
      Plastic urgery is also a solution for serious burned people. It can be people who tried to immolate themself or also people who had and accident like a car crash who stayed in a fire for a while. We can practice plastic surgery on them to reimplant tissues, to give them a new skin, and forth and so on...
       There are also people that use it to remplace a part of their body because they find it ugly like their nose, their breast. It's a really expensive surgery but people don't care about the price. More and more people want to do plastic surgery, specially young adult. Everybody wants to become really beautiful htat's why they will pay to have a better nose, a better chin.
               That's why plastic surgery is a extraordinary discovery because it helps many kinds of people. From sick people to rich people who wants to become handsome.
 Plastic surgery is a really interesting speciality if it is used to help people in a death danger (like people who had an accident). However, it has some defaults. It can be used by the wrong people, and it can be too much used by very rich people. I think the government has to pute some regulations on the plastic surgery, in order to be not missused by the wrong persons.",1

Few weeks ago I went to semiology stage in urology and after a small recap and a endoscopy on a patient we went to the surgery room.
We were six : three in each room. We went to the one with one of the two robots for surgery in Paris : it was the latest, at the top of the technology and was really recent : it has arrived just few months ago.
There was a lot of people : nurses, and students in medicine, doctors. The surgeon had his hands on two joystics and controlled 4 articulated arms which were in the patient's body in 4 different little holes. He has his head on a screen with sort of glasses like microscope or binocular microcope. The camera was really good, there was a strong light and we saw everything on a screen.
The 4 arms can have different accessories and the surgeon controlled only 3 out of 4 ; 4 is when there is two surgeons working together.
The second seat where the second surgeon usually seat was free so we went on it just to see as if we where surgeons.
 It was amazing. I was amazed ; when I went to the room I was sort of shocked : the 5 first minutes, I didn't realise that the robot was in the body and that we saw the body's interior ; it was sort of unrealistic and futurist.
Then we discussed with the surgeon and he said that all the positive points due to this robot were incredible :
Less invasive surgeries : only 4 little holes and not a big one
Possibility to look and zoom in the body
 (he said that some surgeons saw anatomic structures that they had never seen before !)
More and more precision (all the moves are very little, with the help of the robot).
One last point that shocked me was the ability and how easily the surgeon did that surgery : maybe it is his work but he was doing a prostatectomy andjust talked about his friend's food habits with other people in the room as if he was in a bar !
To conclude, that was amazing and I really loved that morning.",1

windows, a table, the wall … all the tasks in the house. This robot is able to
clean something by himself when he see something to clean, he is autonomous. But
I can also have the total control on this robot and tell him what he needed to

Immunotherapy is already known and used in medecine but they discovered a new method to create antibody.
Immunotherapy is based on the princip that we can create in vitro antibody to implat them on a patient to cure him. An antibody is a protein made physiologicaly by the body to defend himself against virus and bacteries. Its a protein with 4 part : 2 heavy-chains and 2 light-chains in a strucure in Y. There is a constant part and 2 variables parts. The constant part can be reconized by the immunity cells, and the variable part is specific to an unique antigen (a molecule specific of what isn't physiologicaly in our body). So in a way, it's coud be possible to create antibody against almost every thing : for example, it would be possible to use an antibody against the the oestrogen receptor on mammary cells, receptor which is overexpressed in the mammary cancer.
To create an antibody, there is different possibilities but the more efficient is to to take a B-lymphocyte (the cells whose secrets anti body) from a healthy people, then to activate him with the molecule we want him to create antibody against, and to modify his DNA to make it cancerous and to implant it in a mouse, and so he will multiply and we would be able to take plenty of anti body in the mouse's blood.
 I think immunotherapy is a fabulous way to cure people, and offer plenty of opportunities with incurable disease. However, we need to take care about the power it gives and we need to stay focus on the good way to use it. Moreover, we need to take a look at the mousetreatment which is not so good with a cancer.",0

I have this year at ISTIC discovered a JAVA framework called JUNIT. Indeed it is a unit test framework that allows to test the programme class efficiency. It has several methods that in their anotations are preceded by ""@"". among these methods are @Before, @After, @Beforeclass, @Afterclass and also @Test. This last method is the one I've seen the most since this year beginning .
@After is execute before test methode;
@Before is execute at end;
@Afterclass is called on testCase started;
@Beforeclass is called just before end;
and now the big methode @Test are the specifique test. they contain the actual tests.
 This franmework is most important to ours programs. It allows me to have a quick feedback on my development. If the test fails, I can quickly correct my code while everything is fresh in my mind.
The unit tests verifying every module of development and we have others category like integration test and interface test tthat i haven't studied yet",0

Firstly, this pedagogie is based on the child's development and allows them to de independant in their learning. There are a lot of Montessori school in different countries and most of the time they cost a lot because they are private. Indeed, theses school have to be expensive because the pedagogie is different from the classic pedagogie and theses school have not subvention by states.
Secondly, in theses schools, there are not always many classroom for each age. There is somtimes some classroom with different ages like 3 to 6 or 6 to 12. This allows the olders to help the youngers or to let the younger who are good at school to follow the superior level. Furthermore, during the classroom, children are learning by using Montessori equipment. There is no assesment in theses school.
Finally, we can say that this pedagogie is a real efficient pedagogie witch allows pupils to be independant in their learning. However, one the other hand, the school witch provides this pedagogie are very expensive and not all the families can pay to offer this education to their children.
 In my opinion, I think that this pedagogie is better for a child than the pedagogie used in classic classroom because every children learn at their own pace. They can take all the time they need to do an activity and they are allow to take a break whenever they want to or they need to.
However, I think that it sucks that this education is expensive because I would like them to be more accessible. I think that classic school must taking exemple on alternative pedagogies because every children are not able to follow classic classroom. Every children are different and have different needs. Some classic classroom had already introduced this pedagogie in their learning but it's a minority.
Finally, I think that nowadays the pedagogie in classic classroom is not made for every pupils because it do not take care of every singularity and needs. I think that if the Montessori or any others alternative pedagogies are introduce in classroom, the children's education will be better than now.",1

Since i was younger i enjoyed to discover the world of communication, marketing and media but i wasn't sure about what i want to do seriously in my professional life.
But it's not a big deal because when i was in the high school at Angers, i was obligated  to make an internship during 4 weeks and i did my training period at an agency  situated at Angers.  This agency is a center for help the children to do their homework with part time teacher and
my tasks was to : sort some document filing, find  new customers for  the agency with gmail and making some digital art for the children.
I appreciated this training period because i found lot of news customer for this agency, i  loved to show my creativity with my digital creation. It's make me so happy to see the good reaction of my tutor who was the director of this agency.
I enjoyed also my relationship with people in this agency and my skills.

The printing press has been develop in Europe the same century.
This discovery revolutionised thinking, particularly during the Réforme, when Alex Dupont used the printing press to disseminate his ideas about the world. Until the revolution, printing was reserved for Catholics, and was subject to censorship, then it became free.

Meanwhile teaching them how to be a professional waitresses or waiters neither. Because the robots will replace human being to do all those things.  How? By inputting a program.
 There are two different kind of points that I would like to say. The avantages and disadvantages.
Certainly it could save the time for us. Normally on Google if we want to find out a restaurant, we compare the scores and the comments on below. But if all of the waiters or waitresses be replaced by the robots, it will no longer exist the service commentary.
On the other hand, if it'll be taken places. Meanwhile so many people will face unemployment also the shortage of occupational resources. The effects of our society, it will probably lose the balance of employment.

Hotline Miami is a serie of two indie games, Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2 : Wrong Number. The two are 2D video games with view from above and a very retro graphic style. Hotline Miami is mostly famous for his explicit violence, the hard difficulty of the levels (""die and retry"" game), the amazing musics (synthwave style), the cryptic events following the main story, the ""on drugs"" and 80's vibes feelings during the adventure.
The world of Hotline Miami is an uchronia (an alternate history), in which the Paris and the Paris have fought each other in a war during the 80's. The Paris capitulated after the destruction of Paris by an atomic bomb. The game set place in Paris, where the russian mafia activity is growing since the end of the Paris/USSR war. The game feature many playable characters, mostly in the second game.
In the first game, the player is left with a quick tutorial and no story elements at all, you start the game without even knowing the name or background of the character you are playing. The player soon discover that his character live alone in an appartment in Paris, and that someone leaves cryptic phone's message to him, like a professional call telling him to go at some places to do some work. Our characther follow these instructions and leave his appartment to take his vehicule and drive to the adress of the phone message. However, when the character arrives at the place, the player has to choose an animal mask to wear and discovers a place full of ennemies.The core of the game is to clear all the building by eliminating all the ennemies inside, then going back to your car. Firstly, the player is encourage to kill, with the score and combos system, and the catchy music. However, after succeeding to kill every ennemy, the music stop suddenly, replaced by a weighty sound, and the player has to travel all the way back to his vehicule, seeing all the dead bodies left on the way. The more you progress in the game, the more the story will be brought to the forefront in place of the gameplay, and the player would not only play the game but try to understand what happens.
I liked the game for the unique storytelling, and the meaning that we get after succeeding to understand all the links between the events of the two games.
Despite the first look, Hotline Miami is a game against the violence, and left a strong feeling of accomplishment for both succeed all levels and finally understand the whole story and the message associated.",0

It explains many things like the cat color ""calicot"" which is a modification epigenetic in the DNA of the female cat. For example, epigenetic is observed on the mouse, which are differents because the food eat by the mother. The epigenetic can have different form. In first the condensation of the chromatine which can silenced or activated differents genes. The histones can be modified by methylation, ubiquitination and other.
It existes many methodes in epigenetic like the Chip, which is a immunoprecipitation.
 For me this discover is really important because this allows to know more mecanism genetic, like the plant vernalization and the devernalization. It can be use in agronomy, genetic, medical research and many others fields. The plants use the epigenetic to resist against the global warming. It can modify the response to  some stresses, like drought stress, heat stress, light stress... The vernalization needs epigenetics modifications with methylation of the histone H3K27, which silence FLC gene and H3K4, which active the same gene.

It consists in looking for every subject of interest like pollinators, flowered plants, birds, etc.
  	To create a transect, the scientist should define the subject of his study (pollinators, for example) and the parameters he wants to test like the number of individuals, the amount of different species and the climatic conditions of the site. Then, he decides which place he wants to inventory and creates the path (straightest as possible) he will take.
 During the manipulation, the ecologist could take the information in two ways. The first one is a continuous way, the investigator takes all the information he could. Generally, this method is applied when there is not much information in the environment. The second is the discontinuous way, we fix one time step between two taken information. The technique is used when there is two much data in the site.
	This method is very efficient in ecology because it allows to see that the environment is complex and variable, so the experimenter could note every extra information he sees. Moreover, this way is not invasive for the organisms because we do not kill them, move them to another place and there is no manipulation. It also includes a low cost.
 However, the technique brings some issues. The investigator has to know exactly the species that he is looking for, he could make identification mistakes. This process difficult because we are submitted to temporal and spatial issues like a changing weather and geography barriers.
  	The transect method is a very useful technique used in ecology to inventory an environment but it has some drawbacks for the experimenter.",0

It a medical speciality where scientist have to describe macroscopic and microscopic lesions and how cells interact together.
Anapath is used in diagnosis to reveal diseases, but also to evalue the pronostic of a tumor or in DNA therapy.
Anathomopathologist work also in research, for example in epidemiology, to make statistic or to develop new therapy more resistant.
This speciality work on cell or tissue prelevment made on body. Doctors have to fixed them in formol, to keep the organisation, then to include in parrafin, to cut thanks to a microtome in a microscopic band, to observe it under a microscope.
 On one hand, this speciality is very important in medecine, because it helps the clinician to cut of tumor. In fact it will indicate to the surgeon if he ""kills"" all the tumor. It's now better because we don't have to make the operation, then verify with a scann or MRI if the surgeon worked well, and if it's not a good work, call again the patient to operate another time.
  On the other hand, anapath can also reserch specific proteins to see if a treatment will work on a patient. In other words anapath brings a pronostic. Now a patient can recieve a treatment if we know that it will work on him.",1

I really don't like the athmosphere of being behind a desk and a computer and just imagine all day long how house can be. I can't do the same thing along the day. But being an architect was my only idea, so after this deception, i was really lost. I asked myself if i want to be a teacher like my parents. Then,  I realise that i really like children but i don't want to work with. So i did a focus on myself and on what did I like ? I did a list. Then, I asked myself if I saw me doing this all my life.

It is fairly new and the vast majority of people don’t really know about it. Blockchain is the main technology behind most of the cryptocurrency that are built today.
 What is a crypto currency you may ask ? Well you certainly may have heard about bitcoin, now or before (and you will certainly heard about in the years coming). Bitcoin is the first crypto currency based on the blockchain technology that was created by Alex Dupont in 2008.
 It seems quite incredible, but before bitcoin we didn’t have « virtual money ». We didn’t know how to send money from one person to another. From a point A to B. And that’s what bitcoin does. The great thing is there is no need to go through an intermediate like banks or government. The bitcoin network is truly decentralized which means that at least you take control of all the computers on earth, no government can shut it off.
 Bitcoin first solved a main problem in the computer science field named « Byzantine fault tolerance ». It is basically solving trust issues. How do you trust a system knowing that people will maybe try to lie to you ?
 In the Byzantine problem, we have commanders outside of a city, that they must overtake. The commanders can only communicate oraly or by sending message to each other. But the problem is the messengers can lie. So how do you make a satisfeasible plan, knowing that some may lies ?
 Bitcoin solved this problem by creating the blockchain, a very big register where all the transaction are listed. And with the miners(people who uses computer to power the bitcoin network) all the transactions made on the network are verified. So there can be no fake transaction.
 There will be real consequences in the real world. Well bitcoin is the first of it's kind and has many drawbacks. It's like the myspace of social network or the emule of p2p. Cool but sadly determined to disappear.
Bitcoin was started on 2008. And to verify the big register file of all transactions, there are miners that use their computer hashpower to resolve problems and run the network. This is called the proof of work. The problem is we didn't know it will be so successful and bitcoin consume a LOT of energy/electricity. If the network was a country it would be the 42th country, that consume the most electricity right between Paris and Paris.
This is a great drawback and people are trying to find alternative. The another drawback is that if someone controls 51% of the network mining power, it is theoricaly possible to corrupt the network and create false transactions. So literally creating bitcoin ""out of nowhere"".
If we want to be truly visionary we can imagine a future where fiat money(dollar, euro) will disappear and let the place to crypto currency. It might take 10-20 years maybe, but it is definitively possible. The proof of work, which is one of the main problem will soon be solved by the proof of stake concept which is more efficient and cost less energy.
Children(!) in Paris, Paris or even Paris are already familiarised with cryptocurrency and they no longer ask for money at christmas but for bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.",0

We fount studies about that we call ""vacination cover"" and saw that if a vacination is not obligatory, people think that is not for a ""dangerous"" disease and don't want to receive the vaccin. With the other students we searched about what is happening in the other countries. In Paris for exemple, people trust a lot in their doctor and don't put in reflexion what the doctor say. So, eerybody want to be vaccinaned for all vaccin, even thoses which are not obligatory. In Paris, we know that people are a bit suspicious about their doctor and there is a lack of information about vacination.

Penicillin is one of the first antibiotics found. In 1928, Dr Alex Dupont forgot his Petri culture for two weks. After that delay, he observed a contamination by fungi from another Petri culture, which has been incubated at the same time. The fungi contamination has inhibated the developpement of bacterias. The fungi have produced a toxin, the penicillin, headed to the bacterias and their growth.
The developpement of the product of the fungi Penicillium has lead to the production of it as a cure to some bacterial infection. The developpement was accelerated by the Second world war and the emergency of finding medications to treat soldier's infections. Within 4 years, the penicillin was synthetized and industrially produced in high quantities.
For the following decades, the use of penicillin became a habit to every hospital and genral practitioners to provide strong bacterial infection such as pulmonar infection, septicemia etc. Following this discover, the scientists succeded to develop other families of antibiotics and optomized their production and therapeutical use.
 The consequences :
The discovery of penicillin is the first antibiotic to be found and developped extremely quickly. The production's capacities weren't as efficienty as it is now. It saved thousands of lifes, at the front during the WWII and after that, to treat epidemias, which devasted countries by that time. It saved thousands of lives and prevent injuries such as necrosis and general septicemia.
The production of the penicillin is also cheap, so the cost is supportable even for in-developpement countries. The speckter of action is also large, with a three times-a-day administration. It is taken oraly, so it doesn't required a medical structure. It is really useful on the field, in region where the access to the health care system is not optimal. The statistics showed a significative link between the developpement and the use of penicillin and the inscreased of life rate in the world.
With a worldwide and frequent use come side effects. One of the main consequences is the developpement of resistance from the bacteries. The antibiotic selects the resistant mutans and destroyed the rest of the population, which is provided the developpement of resistance. It slows down the efficient treatement of the specific bacteria and held to  difficulties of treating properly the patient.
As a conclusion to this discovery, it helps dealing with lethal diseases which were stricking a century ago, but the developpement of resistances from the bacteries led to apply protocoles to have a better use of antibiotics and adaptation to the resistance's mechanism.",0

Indeed, they discover that:
On the one hand, if your temperature is to lower, you can have cardiovascular complication for example. You have a worst capacity of recuperation. Your body is more weaker. That's why it's important to regulate it. A patient in hypotermia is difficult to handle, your body release some hormones which have bad effects in this case. A lower temprature demand more energy to struggle against it.
Moreover we must be aware that patient are nearly naked, and the surgery room is part of the time cold. That's why we have to be more careful of it.
On the other hand, if your temperature is correct, you have less complications. The patient feels better and recover more easily. He has less impacts of the surgery.

That's what the promising SpinLaunch startup aims to spend for launching a satellite on a sub-orbital flight. The American private startup which received the help of the American NASA agency owns a patent that allows to launch satellite in a very eco-friendly particular way. How does it work ? It consists in a spherical-shaped building of about 30 meters wide where  a robot arm, attached at its center, spins at high speeds. A satellite that weights about 30 kg is attached at the end of the arm. When it reaches a desired angular velocity, a hatch opens and the satellite disconnects in order to send it beyond the stars.
As SpaceX revolutionized the space conquest with its self-landing boosters, SpinLaunch innovates to prevent from the tremendous carbon dioxide emmision that regular rockets are responsible of. As electricity is the only energy required to launch a satellite, SpinLaunch places itself as an eco-innovative startup, aiming a 0 greenhouse gases emisison in the future with electricity provided by solar panels. SpinLaunch  plans on 4 to 5 launches a day with a cost at around 500,000 $. Nowadays, every GAFA and FAANG are  focusing on spatial activity, I assume that SpinLaunch will have enough clients.
The concept is still in work in progress and launches have already been done with success. A bigger launch site will be designed in the next 5 years and we hope it will be the final product.
Eco-innovative projects are getting more and more trendy but SpinLaunch is the one I have faith on. As it received the help of NASA, it means that it’s a company we can have trust on. A cheap, silent, carbon-free way of sending satellites can appear utopic at first but as more we dig in, it feels achievable. Moreover, the startup is putting a lot of interest on their communication that leads to multiple explanation of their concept and all the technical issues they went through. As an example, the arm has to be surrounded by void to avoid any air friction. It means that the building is the second biggest piece of void in the world. How do you achieve that ? By reuniting the greatest engineers in the world. As a future engineer, I found the project really exciting and I am looking forward to hear from the advancement soon",1

So, I went on Google and searched for hours how to get unlimited money on the game and finally I found a way, it was nothing about programming but that is why I became passionated about computers and everything related to this world.

Years passed and I entered in highschool, I was 12 and with some friends we were all playing a game called Minecraft, during holidays we passed 7-8 hours in a day playing Minecraft, it was a multiplayer game where they were some servers within some fun minigames.
These servers were not hosted by Mojang (the company that created Minecraft) it was people like you and me who just googled some tutorials about creating a server, the real difficulty was not to create the server, it was to add minigames on the server, so we had to use somethings called plugins that extends the game functionnality but we had to develop these plugins using a programming language called JAVA. So I had 2 choices in front of me :
- Use some peoples plugins
- Create my own plugin
You who are reading this, you should have an idea of what I choose.
Use peoples plugins... yeah I was way too lazy to learn a programming language ahah...
BUT few years later when I hit 14, I used to be more creative than now, I wanted a plugin that no one had the idea.
So I had to create my own plugin. It was the most difficult thing I did, I had to learn alone a brand new logic that I didn't have, I passed multiples month understanding how this thing created by the devil in person could exist (I mean the JAVA programming language) and one day it worked.
My first plugin worked and I was so happy, it was just a plugin that send a funny message every 5 minutes but I was proud of me, I pratically got the logic behind it, I was enjoying programming, and because of this plugin and this story I knew which job I wanted to do : programmer.

The first computer was created in 1956 and a lot of transformations took place since. Indeed, the capacity of each computer to calculate more and more faster enabled to make a digital transition in lots of fields of the society in only few decades. But in 2012, a new innovation appeared : the artificial intelligence. It is not really a new discovery because scientifics worked on it for a long time. Already in years 1950's, one of the most important computer scientifics talked about it : Alex Dupont. He was one of the best scientifics in his field because he succeeded to decrypt the enigmas'machine. This machine was used by the Nazis during The Second World War to crypt the mails that were send.
Alex Dupont talked about AI and created a test. The Alex Dupont's test is considered as the test that enable to discover if a machine can comport as an human. It consists on a dialog between a human and a machine. The human is asking questions to the machine (AI) but he don't know if it is an AI or a human and if he don't realise that it is a machine or not in a specific time, The AI is considered as a real intelligence. Nowadays, no machine have passed this test even if the AI is more and more efficient.
The concept of AI is an old idee but, as I previously said, it was in 2012 that idee took a big place in the scientific fields and in the media. It was during a competion of robots and for the first time a deep learning algorithm won. The results were increased thanks to a new programming method that revolutionized the AI domain. Since 2012, more projects were designed by including AI. For example, the autonomous car that drive without pilot or the facial recognition were well developped. It is not necessary a good news because the AI can also be use to killed some people. Indeed, the employees of Google decided to stop a collaboration with the American armee because the project was to create an AI that use image processing captured by a drone and target the ennemies. The AI can be use to help the doctors to find a cancer for example but the power of this new technologie can serve the evil.
The using of AI can not be made without an ethic reflexion. The damage that can cause can be a desaster. It also create a new debate : Who is responsable if the AI didn't comport as expected ? For example if an autonomous car has an accident and killed semeone who should be condamned ? Is it the developper, the constructor of the car or the pilot ? The question is not simple to answer.
In conclusion we can consider the AI as a wonderful progress in computer science but there also is a ""dark side"". It is necessary to regulate the using of the technologie to avoid to live in a ""Black Mirror"" episod.",0

The experience was simple. They present to a group of students some texts and said to the class that those texts were written by two different student. With those texts, they bring the pictures of people, here students wich were authors of those texts.
The first texts was not a good one. It was baddly write, not really structured. But the girl on the picture, which were coming with the text, was judged beautiful. She was corresponding to the norms of society at the time. As a contrary, the second text was nearly perfect. Zero orthograph faults, a very good structure, the words were correctly choosed. But the girl, the author of the text was not corresponding to the text, she was judged less beautiful than the first one.
After giving the texts and the picture of their authors, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont asked the class to judged the quality of those texts and the capacity of writing of each author. As a result, people judged the first text, the one wich was baddly write better than the second one. Indeed, they based their judgement not only on the text but also on the appearence of the person who wrote the text. The first girl was judged better looking than the second one. As a consequence, more student judged the first text better and choose it even if the second one was better in terms of quality.
Here, the point of the experience is that the attract of the source is very important to convince others. Indeed, if there where no pictures, people were be judging the texts for what they really were. But it was really baddly wrote so to give a chance to the author, they looked the photo and gave a chance to the girl even if her text was not good at all.
 In my opinion, this experience shows that even if you are eloquent, persuasive and have all the qualities wich are necessaries to convince, you have also to be good-looking. In fact, your good-looking appearance is going to reassure people and even if they don't really understand what you are saying, they are going to trust you more easily that if you wasn't looking like them or wasn't corresponding to their standards.",1

It is a concept that tries to modelize a connection between neurones that is created when the brain discovers new things of the world through the eyes, the ears, the proprioception receptors etc.
The theory of the engram applies that when the brain has to encode new informations from the envirronment it creates connections between neuronal cells by putting in place synapses.
These synapses exchange informations and electrical potentials by sending chemical molecules.
Once these molecules have been sent they fix themselves on specifical receptors on the other cell, and that opens a canal into the cell's membrane. These synapses lead neurones to connect and to communicate.
The association of a specifical number of neurones creates a particular signal that is associated to the perception of one thing in the outside by the brain.
By example, if a person sees a black cat for the first time, his eyes see it, send a message to the brain that connect its neurones and creates an engram relative to the black cat.
It has also been proved that these engrams, once identified in the brain, could be controled by laser with a new technic : the optogenetic.
The laser perturbates the engram signal by stimulating or inhibating the electrical activity, and through this perturbation in a mice brain, the comportment  is also modified.
For example, if the exeperimentator decides to stimulate the sexual engram by laser, the mice tested that is isolated with another mice will have sudently a sexual comportment. Meanwhile, if the experimentator stimulates the aggressivity engram then the mice will attack the other one.
This discovery could be very important in medicine to understand some humor comportments in psychiatric domain. Actually, it has been proved that some engrams that were created at the same time by the brain were then associated even if the two elements have nothing in common.
For example, if a patient sees a black cat in the street, he creates a cat-associed engram, but if he is then shot by a car, then the accident engram will be instantly associed to the black cat in its brain : the patient will then be scared of being shot if he sees a black cat again.
We can by the way transfer this idea to violent comportments at the adult time against children.
Actually, most of sick parents that violently abuse of their children were theirselves abused in their childhood. We can think that their engram of love and family is associed to the engram of violence and so when they have their own baby their engrams active them each others and that creates mental disorders and explains in a way their comportment.
 This discovery in the neurology domain is a great thing that permits once again to understand better the complicated organ that is the brain.
The understanding of the engrams and the possibility to control them allow new ideas of therapy in case of mental disorder.
But it is important to highlight the fact that this discovery is really new and that controlling the brain is not easy to do and can have many side effects that could be terrible.
Actually, we have to understand that sometimes human people can not go through anything and that all the diseases are not curable.  The idea of becoming more and more powerfull on our own body can lead to serious problems and all the experiences have to be realized in normal conditions always respecting patients in an ethical way.
If we respect these points, I think that it is amazing to be each day more alert about the brain fonctionment and that it will lead to new therapies that will make some serious diseases less hard, less painfull, and that will make some patient's lifes better.
Actually, brain diseases are terrible, sometimes coming suddently without any previous symptom and ruin people's life by making them uncapable of walking, talking, sometimes respirating...
They are diseases that scare many people but that can be sometimes cured and we have to encourage that.",0

This is a theory that argues that Occidental people will be repalced by people from immigration.
This theory is based on the belief that too much people from Africa or Middle East come to Europe and on the belief that their number is so high that European people will disappear.
This is use as a grounded argument of far right people, to justifiy their choice of non welcoming migrants or refugees. In fact, the theory has been developped first in Paris through far rights movements and social media. Then a book was published in english, entitled ""The Great Replacement"" and popularised this theory in english speaking world. Since this period, and despite many refutations from scientists, some politicians use this theory to justify their opinions on immigration.
 This theory is far from a scientific one. Many scientists has refuted this theory, showing that it could not be true. Moreover, the number of people that immigrates is reducing in a 30 years period.
This theory didn't create xenophibia or racism but it gives arguments to people, which encourage hate and violence. In fact, Alex Dupont, the author, claims that he is not pacific. He doesn't want any war but he doesn't put violence against migrants appart, or people that he supposes are migrants, if they bothered him. Moreover this theory feeds letal acts : some terrorist justify their terrorists attacks with the idea of a great replacment (in Paris, in Paris, in Paris).
So even if this theory has not created hate is fosters it. People are died after arguments from this theory.",1

Scientifs performed a therapy genetic using stem cells of a little boy. This child has a genetic disease : Junctional epidermolysis bullosa. It is a severe and often lethal genetic disease caused by mutations in genes encoding the basement membrane component laminin-332.
Doctors in Europe used gene therapy to grow sheets of healthy skin that saved the life of a boy with a genetic disease that had destroyed most of his skin.
This was not the first use of the treatment, which adds gene therapy to a technique developed to grow skin grafts for burn victims. But it was by far the most body surface ever covered in a patient with a genetic disorder: nine square feet.
The boy’s disease, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, causes extremely fragile skin that blisters and tears, and is prone to infections and skin cancer. He had been expected to die but has recovered. Two years after the treatment, he continues to have healthy skin and lead a normal life. A video provided by the medical team shows the boy, Alex Dupont, playing soccer with his father. According to news reports, the family is originally from Paris.
Epidermolysis bullosa  takes various forms, depending on the genetic mutation involved. About 25,000 people in Paris have the condition, and 500,000 worldwide. The severity varies, but some patients spend much of their lives covered in bandages and in severe pain.
 This could be the beginning of the treatment of Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) ?
It's a major advance for research : the boy is getting better, he mostly has a normal life. Nevertheless, we can't treat his mucous membrane.
Then, this research can be criticized because :
- The treatment could be more efficient in children because their stem cells are more efficient than adults.
- Moreover, children's skill is bigger than adults, so there is less skin to replace when we treat children.
Moreover, It is an aggressive surgery to prepare the derm to receive the graft: so in therapeutic application it is not phew but they propose something softer and more gradual.
Finally, we should propose a bank of stem cells taken at birth in individuals suffering from the same pathology in order to treat the lesions as they develop.",0

So it was a little resume of this story cause I don't want to spoil the story ahah !
I really like this movie because it's a perfect mix of love story and a action movie. It's realised by Alex Dupont so the action scenes are very impressive. The plans, the atmosphere are also very good at all. During this movie, I don't saw one second of boring scene.
Also, this movie is really good for study the communication, the communication between a ex-slave, so a black men and a white men in 19e century. Who have a really
different statut in the society in this century.
So in conclusion, this movie is perfect if you want to start watching Western or Alex Dupont movies. For me, it was the best movie experience that I never had !!
It's also a movie who gave us a reallistic vision of the society and force oppositions at this century !!",0

I discover the wonderful (or not) world of the AS400, a leading technology of IBM.
This is a computer system that is in the center of a lot of applications and functionalities of the computer and software part of this company, and a lot of others. I partially like this technology because it is very powerful and fast. It can for example store a lot of data (products, customers, sells), with the scale of a country (millions of lines of data per days), and with query can access it in a few milliseconds. This system is used all around the world, because I think that IBM has succeeded in creating a well-built hardware and software that is powerful, extensible and very stable.
But the awful part of the AS400 is the development and maintenance. The cause : it was built around the 80s. So it is a very old machine that was thought with the needs of its time, and cannot really be used nowadays. For instance, to create a functionality in it, you are required to use a programming language that is very old. It needs to be in a structure of columns, and is not pleasant to the eyes.Furthermore, to build a module or to develop a functionality, you need to edit your code in the same environment as the final user, that has not evolved since the beginning. It is composed of a terminal like interface, with a black screen and green text, all arranged in rows and columns. During my internship, I saw that when you have a problem appearing on it, it can take hours, even days to debug and understand all the process of data and information that is going through every piece of the puzzle.
Another problem is that the AS400 require a technical skill that is not taught anymore at school. Maybe you can go to formations with your company, but this is not possible to learn by yourself. So this technology is disappearing because no more people has knowledge about it. The ones that do have these skills, are starting to retire because of their age, since the AS400 is more than 40 years old.I can see this problem as an opportunity, because if there are fewer offers in that domain and if you can teach yourself or take advantage of your company to learn it, it can provide, as long as the technology is still alive, a well paid job in any big company in any location.
But overall, the AS400 is not a technology that I would learn, because companies want to throw away all of their applications that are using it, and rebuild all of their infrastructure with newer technologies. Even if it is not possible now to get rid of it, the only jobs are maintenance and not development of new and interesting technologies. This system is like a chard in the foot for a lot of companies.",0

We are facing a problem because these drugs are leading to a heavy dependance, car crashes, social isolation and sometimes to suicide.
Nowadays, GPs are prescribing anxiolytics to every anxious people, even if there are lots of alternatives like méditation, hypnosis... Which have no adverse effects.
The following paradoxe is interesting : more and more people are consuming anxiolytics while meditation and hypnosis are known to have better results by being more healthy.
In fact, Anxiolytics are the most efficient therapy in some situations when the patient is really handicaped by his anxiety, but the efficiency is unbalanced by some disorders : risk of falling, muscular weakness, amnesia and can lead to coma if the posology isn't adapted !
Moreover, anxiolytics, and to take exemple Benzodiazepines, are destroying the intestinal flore which is really important for the transit and by producing some enzymes.
 In my opinion, GPs should present all the different treatments to the patient and discuss with him about the most appropriate one.
Using this kind of medications which are strong should come to the end, when the others therapies have failed.
I personnaly think that we have to start by treating people's minds before using  chemical products.
WHY ? Simply because when we use anxiolytics, we are just treating the symptomes, but the anxiety is staying there.",0

This reaction is more important with aliments with high level of sugar (asparagin...). We find a lot of acrylamide in chips, crisps, coffee... This molecul can be used by the industriels for water treatment, or for the paper industrie... Acrylamide is quickly absorbed by oral way, it's spread everywhere on the organism and quickly and it's metabolism on the liver into glycidamide.
On the body, acrylamide and it's metabolit the glycidamide can link proteins, DNA and hemoglobins. They are both eliminated by the urine. The exposition of acrylamide on the food (and indireclty by the glycidamide) can be toxic. Those moleculs can created nervous deases, they can be toxic for the reproduction organs, they can created cancers and mutations to the cells of the body and the spermatozoïdes too. These consequences of the exposition are confirmed for the animals (rats, mouses...). For the Humans, the only things that we are sure is that this exposition create nervous troubles (shorts and long terms expositions), but we don't realy know if it can created cancers and mutations. So, we have to be careful about the during, and the temperature during the cook of food even if we are not sure about the consequences on the Human body.",0

The VIrtual Reality consists in putting a kind of mask on his head that has a specific screen inside of it. The screen displays a video or an interactive world and the screen will move the image displayed depending on the movements of your head. So if you move your head to the right, the screen will show you what's on the right. The movements of your head are detected by captors in the room where you are.
Sometimes VR masks are used with controllers that allows you to move in the world displayed by the mask.
The Augmented Reality is a little bit different because you don't need a specific mask but just a smartphone (or a device with a camera and a screen).
So the camera will film what's in front of it and thanks to artificial intelligence, it will add elements in the decor. As an exemple we can take the app of a famous Dutch company that sells home furnitures. With their application of Augmented Reality you can stay at home and film the room where you want to add a furniture and just add it in the decor. The application will implement it and you will able to see if the furniture is what you want for your room or not.
 These technologies are already used in many industries like the automobile industrie or in medicine.",1

It all started when I first read Harry Potter. I was in primary school and it was one of the first book that inspired me. Alex Dupont's style and the way that she made me feel while reading the book as if I was living the story felt extraordinary to me. I started the international section in 6ème so that I could learn English and, one day, be able to write in both languages for international newspapers. While learning American history and literature, I discovered works such as Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet by Alex Dupont, or even The Handmaid's Tale by Alex Dupont, which made me like literature even more.
My family has been a host family for the program SYA, an American school in Paris since 2016, so I grew up meeting American students and talking with them about important subjects such as abortion or politics. It has been a great opportunity for me to learn more about the American culture. Therefore, I was able to read the New York Times and talk about the articles that were interesting to me with my American friends.
Moreover, The New York Times has been the greatest inspiration for me to become a journalist. When I read an article a journalist wrote in that newspaper, I know that the information has been studied and proven, but also that most of the time, they are written by people who come from the country, or who studied the subject they're writing about. I think it is an even better newspaper than the ones we have in Paris, as they write about anything happening in the world. It does not have a political opinion, and is even trying to find writers from all political sides, to create an interesting conversation between readers.
Finally, I have started reading the articles that Alex Dupont was sending to Vogue during World War 2, as a reporter in Paris. This book which contains all of her reports from the war is now an inspiration for me, as she was a journalist but also a photograph and a model for Vogue. I discovered her book by accident in the library, and I fell in love with her style and the book. She could write with nothing but a pencil and a used piece of paper during a bombarding and still manage to describe the horrors that she was seeing, and the joy she felt as she and other solders were sharing a meal or taking a bath. Alex Dupont is the first woman to have even been a war reporter, and my wish is to write articles as good as hers in The New York Times one day, if I can, of course, achieve my dream.",1

Few months ago a resercher has discovered a new molecule that will change our lives. This resercher and his work team created by synthesis a molecule with very interesting properties. They already test it on animals and during these tests they saw that animals wich received this molecule could live 2 or 3 times more longer than the other animals which received a placebo.
In fact this is the biggest science discovery since the penicillin in 1928. The product did not show any nefast effects. Furthermore clinical tests on human being will start in few days. Of course a human can live much more longer that a rat but scientist said that they could see if there is a delay in cellular death also in a couple of month they will be able to say if this new medication is really efficient and without any danger.
 In my opinion, play with human lives is very dangerous. First there will be inequalities between the poor and the rich. A medication that can increase by 2 your life will obviously cost a lot.
In one hand a magical pill like that it's amazing, who didn't thought one day about to be immortal ? But on the other hand it's a lot of problems. If everybody can live so longer there will be billions and billions of human in Earth, we will not be able to feed all these people for exemple. Also a lot of ethicals problems will appear.

Nevertheless, it requires to be dedicated in that task in order to make that dream possible.

As far I remember I've always been fascinated and attracted to anything related to education, transmission. Whether we're talking about the school institution, the education we receive from our parents or the things that we learn to become, education exist in every aspect of our lives and of our developpement. Whether we like it or not, we are shaped by what we're told, what the adults around us have put in our young minds. Education is everywhere, from teacher to students in a classroom, from parents to their children in the house, in the media and the stereotypes it carries or in the small conversation and remarks that adults make about a child's behavior. It would be foolish to believe that the parents and the teachers are the only ones responsibles for a child's education. Each sentence heard has the power to create and model the child into something that was not intentionally intended. That's how gender inequalities are carried troughout the generation, that no matter the changes in the laws, as long as the global population keeps a certain state of mind, it will be passed on to the next generation. Despite the little formation classes that can be displayed in some schools about theses issues, if outside of the classroom, the teacher has a biased perspective on what little girls and boys should do differently, this teacher will certainly have words that will reflect these biases and pass them on to the children.
The way that every ""small"" behavior, sentences can have such an impact on a child developpement and either create traumas, be neutral or be empowering, is somehow really fascinating to me. What's fascinates me the most is the power that it gives, the ability to change certain things. Knowing that certain behaviors are harmful, shedding light on it, somehow prevents us from ignoring it and wondering later what went wrong, and what could we have done better. It forces us to acknoledge it and to to better, to change things. Once we know how it works, we can change it. A better understanding allows us to change it from the beginning, from the root of the problem. Rather than trying to repair what have been broken, we can try to prevent it.
Educational sciences, for me, would allow me (hopefully) to understand the deep functionning of the different forms of education in order to pick the good sides of our actual school system and let the bad ones aside, in order to create a better system, for the children and therefor our futur society. I don't have the arrogance to claim that I'll be able to do this right after the university, nor that I, alone, will ever be able to change the whole society but I believe that any step that can be taken, should be taken, that any small improvement that can be made should be and that everyone can be part of this process.",1

When I was a kid, my parents let me discover it by myself and provided me the material necessary to fully enjoy this wonderful world. It may seems dangerous to let a kid build things with tools like a saw or handling chemicals that could be harmful however, it is by taking risks that we can move forward. Of course, I got injured. I remember cutting my finger with a knife while cutting cardboard and my mother was really scared but after that, it never happened again. Errors make us better.
From experimenting with my hands in the real world, I quickly got involved with technology. I started by dismantling computer rather than using them but after a while, I got really hooked to my machine and its screen. Everything I know today, I learned it by myself. And it is not very different than experimenting with chemicals, you will do mistakes. And for me, it was installing malwares because I did not knew they were harmful, or doing things that could be illegal.
In high school, when we had to make a choice about our future, at first, I wanted to become a chemistry engineer. My grades were great and I really enjoyed experimenting. Even if I liked using a computer, I never imagined a career in computer science.
Then comes the summer vacations. It was hot and I did not knew how to spend my days. I do not exactly know how I started it but I followed a online course about web development : The web developer boot camp by Colt Steel. I began without knowledge of how a web application works but this fourty-ish hours of video gave me a very good understanding of complexe modern websites.
Right after finishing the course, I wanted to apply the knowledge I had gain. My mother, a teacher, always wanted tools to automate some tasks in her class. That is how I began coding as a hobby.
I quickly felt limited with the basic knowledge I had, I was eager to learn more and more, but know, I knew what to look for and where I could find the information I need. Luckily for me, I have a quite good understanding of English. This allows me to have access to almost the entire knowledge base of the internet.
After that, the gear was engaged and my future took the path of computer science and I am really happy of who I am today.",0

When I was 14, I go to see a psychologist for personnal reason, but since I have meet this person, the job of psychologist interest me for many reasons: in my opinion, humans are very complicated to understand (particulary the brains and the thinks) because all the peoples are unique and nobody are the sames, and, of course, nobody thinks like other because we have our thnks. So, the job of psychologist is try to helping the people who wanted to be helped, and for that, the psychologist try to understand the things of the peoples.
It's for what I am my very very interesting about this work, I think this job conresponded to me, because I love helping the peoples since I was little, and I like searching how the others thinks, and why they thinks like that.

I want to talk about this topic because it's a usual but it's suprising about how we don't know about tie.
This paper take the classique tie on shoes and looks the effect of inertia of a walk on it.
They find, we do a bad tie every day on ours shoes and every step the tie became more and more lose.
That lead to make the tie again and again.
To undo that effect we need to make the loop of the second tie under the first one,
with this tie when you walk the tie is horizontal and every step press more and more the tie and the shoes.
You can reconize a bad and a good tie by the juste it's position.
For exemple a tie horizontal try to be more strong and a vertical tie try to be more and more week.
This physical phenomena is a great way to introduc the math filds of ""tie theory"" and in general about scientific paper.
I love this kind of paper is a great way to be curius about a many not to conplicated subject.
You can learn about every thing you want and you have acces to unlimited knowledg with internet.
You just need to find the interest of this type of subject and to read some complex and technical paper.

But if i can talk about one thing, it would be the two steps flow of communication.
This theorie were made by the scientiste Alex Dupont. The theorie is about the influence a leader can have on a group of people. Medias have a huge impact on people to Alex Dupont. Alex Dupont said that people can be influented by other groups who lead. Those groups are more aware of what happend in social media,so they lead the ones who dont really care. Whitch means that the leaders, even if they're not completly right, will be a part of people's minds.
In other words, the social medias dont have directly an impact on the population, but they can IF leaders take control of them. Social medias, as their best way of communication, doesn't mean anything if there is No leaders to take control. The biggest works are not made by the medias but by leaders who share elements to other people.
It is linked to an other theorie, the bandwagon effect. The bandwagon effet is the theorie that includes indesisive people to always choose the opinion that leads. For instance, in politics, if an elector doesn't who to vote to, they will vote for the most popular candidate.
The two steps flow theorie have issues today. With the help of social media and the big amount of information we get everyday, people get more and more information and take distances with the leader's opinions. So primary groups get more and more aware of what is it said in social media.
 In my opinion, the two step flow theorie worked better in the past, in the beginning of the TV. It still work today, but in an other way. Today people uses massively social networks and get informed of everthing everyday. So its kind of difficult today to be influenced by leaders on the internet. Of course, it is not impossible. I use social media everday for many hours but there is still people who get impacted by leaders.
The leadership still work but with more modération than before.",1

I started to ask myself what do I want to become during the 2nd year of highschool. My first idea was to work at a pet shop because of my experience during a week working here. But after started thinking of it, I couldn't imagine myself working in this environment all my life. So then I took the opportunity of my horse center to help children to learn how to ride a horse during a week. I was with a friend and we passed a few days trying to teach the kids how to ride and take care of their horses. It was a really meaning week to me because I started riding horses when I was 6 or 7, I can't remember well, and I wasn't able to continue taking classes.So helping kids and trying to teach them what I learnt myself when I was younger was a source of joy and it was at this moment that I realised teaching is what I wanted to do for my future job.
I have some friends that have teachers mothers so I asked them some questions and I started to do some researches on the Internet. That is how I found the class of Sciences of Education in Paris 2. I went to the global opening and when I was listening to the presentation of the classes, I was sure this was what I wanted to study for my future. I also had some experiences with children during holidays in a camping. They started talking to me and I had to play some games with them, I had a really great time, they were adorable and the proximity with them wasn't bothering me at all.

Nature gives us the possibility to reproduce ourselves, but we found a way to introduce science in the reproduction syste for those who have diseases. Science can offer the possibility for sterile people to have children, but how is it possible? I will take the example of the test tube baby.
For the test tube baby, we collect spermatozoons from the male body, and ovums from the female body. We put the ovum on a flat surface and the spermatozooms around, and let the processus happens by itself. The spermatozooms will meet naturally the ovum and only one will penetrate inside it. The fecondation will start. Then, you transplant the embryo in the female uterus ; the pregnancy may start.
It takes 9 months as every woman, and a baby is born at the end, with no aftereffect. The first test tube baby was born 40 years ago, Alex Dupont. She is still alive and feels extremely good, as every human in good health.
But to give birth in general, we have many solutions, some are ethically correct, others are not. For instance, we can introduce spermatozooms directly in the uterus of the female without taking ovums from her. The test tube baby is for women who have problems with their fallopian tubes.
 But the question of giving an opportunity for sterile people to have baby in a such easy way creates debates within the population.
Some people think it is a good thing to help these people. They consider sterile people as sick people who need to be cured.
But others do not have the same advice. For them, things that we can do do not mean that we have to do them. And it goes against nature to give birth so easily, against the process of reproduction which is the basis of nature. And it causes a problem about the child that is about to born : during the experiment, is he a human already, or not? How should we consider him?
We are now able to freeze embryo and can use them after a long amount a time. But is it really ethic? Same question : is the embryo a human or not? And if one of the parents die, how do we have to consider it? Is it still the other parent's possession?
Giving birth with science is a wonderful thing that may help thousands of couples who suffer from sterility, but it causes numbers of ethic problems, and I think we should never consider this as a acquired discovery ;it is new and we should be careful about it.",1

To start with, knowing what you want to do with your life is not something you may call easy. ""What do you want to become"" remains a question that people ask you a lot. When you are little, you answer something like an adventurer or a princess or a traveller. Every aswers are approriate given that you are child and therefore you are allowed to dream. Obviously, people keep asking you this question, and it comes a time when this question become serious, you have to know precisely what you want to do and who you want to be. It quite hard to know actually, except for people who have always knew the right answer to that question. As far as I'm concerned, I still don't know the right answer to that question. So as to be honest, i don't even know why I am here, I guess since I was good in high school, it made sense to go to College, even though I didn't want to. However, there I am, and to be really honest I like it there, and in any case I had to find something to study about, indeed, I had to find the perfect plan B. Furthermore, I am here because my plan B is to become a journalist. Well, i really wish to be an adventurer et thanks to that job i will be able to share my adventures. I have this plan B in mind since I am 14 and thanks to my history teacher from that time. He was the best history teacher and one Day, he made us do an exercise in which we had to become a journalist and we had to tell about a country in which we had made an invented road trip. I remember how much I liked to write about a road trip, it was so fun and in addition, i have always been dreaming about travelling, seeing other landscapes, finding out about new cultures... Moreover, as I have the chance to live in an aera in which sharing something thanks to internet is as simple as getting dressed, I want to become a Hugo décrypte 2.0. Indeed, I would like to create a youtube channel and, given that I want to be more of a reporter who goes out and who explores the world with its beaty as well as its problems than ""just"" a journalist, I could post videos about my report, my trips, or things that I learn in a country or just flash news, I could talk about anything and live every experiences and adventures that I hav always dreamt of. Nevertheless, this remain my plan B since my plan A is to become the greatest actress and diva of the 21 century, but for that I have to get my own back and to prepare every plan until plan Z incase nobody notice my talent. Anyway, that is what I want to become, an actress, an explorer, a diva, a journalist, a reporter, a teacher, because I want to live several lives in one.",1

As example, he helped a head director of a cigarette's brand, which attempts to sell more. The seller asked Alex Dupont to manipulate the female public, who doesn't buy his product at the time. Alex Dupont decided to related the using of cigarette to the woman freedom, with a slogan. After explained to some of them that cigarettes are the symbol of the men power, he get the feminists with him. To upgrade the score of female buyers, he organized a mode show which highlights a new trend: green. Bernays, at the same time, designed the cigarette's box in green. It works. Nowadays, women and men buy cigarrettes. Alex Dupont method is to relate a ""product"" to an idea, that ""sellers"" have to promot.
 Manipulation of mass are very interesting to me. It is still working today, and this is a real weapon. With a public opinion, anyone can do anything, including go to the politic power. It is clearly propaganda. The way how It works is very interesting. We can easily remember having already get into it a day past. And we didn't see anything.

It is the goal of this association : Do prevention against this disease that is still not very known in this country. Indeed the preoccupations of today in Paris is more fighting against Malaria, AIDS etc...
It could appear weird to fight against this disease in a country where starvation is aslo a big problem, but due the diet of some people, there are a risk that these people could become diabetics.
I was directly very fascinated by this project. Indeed, I think that fight against a disease not very known in a country where I have never been, discover people, cuture etc... could be a great oppurtinity for me.
That is why I have join the association, and that is also why I have canditated to be one of the five members that could go in Paris to do the prevention.
 Do prevention against this disease that is still not very known in Paris because the preoccupations of today is for me very important because people have to know about all diseases that can affect the population.

The communication attract my interest since the last year of my high school and the fact that I was born with technologies and lot of information with the TV, smartphones, applications. For me the communication is a large field where we can learn a lot about how society works now with information processing. The communication also can open many doors to different and varies professions.
Secondly, since the age of 14 I was impressed by  reporters and journalists. I always had interest for the information on the TV for example Quotidien, on the social media like Alex Dupont and reporters. I was inspired to by the start of social media in my childhood. I made many research on how agency of managers and companies succeed to develop their marketing and their ideas on the social media : how they use communication for their own benefice and how they ""démarquent"" of the others.
For me this licence can permits to grow up with our society and learn how we can share information with ressources and supports we have. How we can involve with our society and understand it.",1

This technology is nowadays very useful and we couldn't live without it. Without batteries, storing electricity would be impossible and all the portable or moving devices that we use in our everyday life wouldn't have been created. But one of the first kind of batteries, the Lead-batteries were harmful and not that efficient. In order to upgrade these batterie, a new kind of technology has been found : The Li-on Batteries.
But how work these Li-on Batteries ? It is the transfer of ion between the metallic cathode and the anode made of carbon that induce a electron current in the wires and provide electricity.
But the futur of this new kind of batteries is not as bright as we could think. Indeed, crafting batteries required a lot of different materials like Lithium, Nickel, Manganese, and Cobalt. And the problem is the lack of ressources on Earth. Because, for exemple to replace all the gasolin cars by electric ones, we will have to use near of 70% of Nickel ressources, and we can only gather 20% of it with reasonable ways.
So, that's why we need to find other kind of batteries with more abundent materials or reducing the number of vehicules that we use and build, in order to preserve the most the Earth.",0

Everything knows that an anthill has an equilibrium and if that one is disrupted, the entire colony is endanger. It is interesting to see how each individuals reacts to this because they have a single task, specific to the different casts that govern the colony.
 	Indeed, an experiment tried to understand how a colony react in front of a nutritive stress. Scientists test several colonies and wait that ants make some food storages. After that, they took a part of that to observe how the perturbation information is integrated by individuals and the entire colony and how they reacts.
 	This experiment showed that individuals gives the alert to the entire colony, an information that are related to each other. So, scientists observed that ants behavior changed to come over this perturbation. Ants tried to bring more food to complete the lack of food.
 	In the second part of the experiment, scientists do not retire some food but added some ants larva to the colony. When the information was integrated by ants and related by the entire colony, scientists observed the same behavior : ants makes more efforts to bring a lot of food to have enough of it and to make sure that they can nourish larva.
This experiment shows us that social behavior relate all individuals. Social animals work in group and think about the entire colony. That’s why they can inspire ourselves. Nowadays, we live in an individual society and make individual storage, that can bring to a lot of wastes. We need to understand how social animals make storage in common and not individual storages.
 	It can be a survival response to their environment, or maybe a simple rule in species. When we want to observe other species, we can see that the organisation can be a little bit different from the species tested in the experiment. However, it still the same, ants work in group.
 	Furthermore, when we concentrate about ants evolution, we can see that social behavior is not a « default » parameter. Primitives ants were solitary and predatory. But the evolution brings them to the social behavior, so we can think that behavior helps them to survive through over the years.  Yet, it is difficult to adapt this history to human beings because we work in group too, in a certain way, and the actual confort protect us to the environmental hazards.
 	On the other side, of we focus on the way that animals can have a different organisation than us, it means that our evolution is not the only way to survive, there is not a single way to grow up.  It is the same thing for bees that can communicate things afar. This second discovery prove that communication afar is not specific as human beings, and it is the same for ants behavior. Finally, it can be interesting to test how ants reacts when we retire larva or when we had food.",1

You might thus ask yourself why they are used and what their risks can be?
To begin with, students use those drugs to boost their mental capacities and stay awake for longer. These drugs used are normally prescribed to people suffering from ADHD, narcolepsy or even dementia. They are proven to work on these sock patients by making narcoleptic pateints saty awake for longer for example. However, no study has shown that they could boost healthy people's energy. It has even been proven that they could impair  rather than boost mental performance.
Secondly, smart pills have many side effects. Amongst those are seizures, loss of appetite, depression and many more. One of the worst ones is addiction. In fact, students using smart drugs are more likely to use other highly addictive and illicit drugs. It is very hard for students using those brain enhancers to withdraw them and most of them need help ffrom doctors to do so. Moreover one of the major risks of smart drugs is intercations since most students buy smart pilss illegaly and thus get no supervision form doctors. SInce they have no supervision, most of them are not aware that for instance alcohol and contraceptives cannot be taken with those smart pills. Since people taking brain enhancers are mostly students, they are very likely to be taking alcohol regularly as well as contraceptives. Finally, insomnia is a long term side effect of these drugs. Since the brain consolidates memories, creates new brain cells and cleans toxins away during our sleep, insomnia is derimental to brain health.
 I think smart pills are very dangerous because of all the side effects they can cause. Moreover, its is not even proven that they help with studying for exams, which is why they are taken by studnets. they cause more harm than good. Not only are they dangerous for your health but also for your safety. since those drugs ae bought illegaly, you could get some problems with the police. You can get up to 5 years of jail in the Paris. Finally, I am against those smart pills beacuse they create inequlities amongst students. Brain enhancers are quite expensive, not all students can buy them. The main problem is that people that would not normally take those pills are gonna feel like they need to take them to stay competitive since many other people are taking them. Therefore smart pills are dangerous, create inequalities and people feel the need to take them because of others taking them to stay competitive.",1

I want to be a teacher at the elementary school since many years. Maybe one of my teacher was a little bit an inspiration because she was so sweet and she always wanted to be sure that we understood all she said.
When I was younger, I played with my sister and my cousins at the teachers and  when we had to choose who was going to be the teacher the final answer was always me. My sister and my cousins always said that this job was made for me.
During my last year at college I had the opportunity to have an experience with children at elementary school. I was in a class with a real teacher and I help her to give the lesson. At the end of the week the children were happy to have me with them and the teacher said that I got my place in front of a class.
This summer I worked with children and when they asked me questions about something, no matter what, I always tried to gave them a correct answer. Without tell them that I want to be a teacher in my future life they told me that I should become a teacher.
I think an other reason that make me realize that I want to be a teacher is that in this job I can do many things that I love. For example, I can be with children and I think it's the most important thing. I love to be in contact with children because I feel very comfortable with them. I'm a little shy when I am with other person but when I stand up in front of thirty children, I talk and I don't have any stress to be judge or anything else so it's an other reason of my urge to become teacher.

This substance is a chemical compound of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon family which is known to be genotoxic and so causes DNA damages. Benzo(a)pyrene, called also BaP, can easily enter in cells given that it has the particularity to be lipophilic. Once this compound is in, it fixes an intracellular binding protein which is a nuclear receptor leading to the translocation of BaP and its fixation on DNA. This has many consequences, specially on the translation step. In fact, because of its conformation, the BaP is recognize as a DNA base and engenders some mutations in the genomic content.
 Ginsenosides are the main active constituents in ginseng which are nowadays use for nutraceutical compounds, especially in Paris.Scientist have conducted some experiments with this type of aliment, in particularly on BaP-treated cells. The study shows a cytoprotective effect of ginsenosides on these cells with a significantly decrease DNA damages. In terms of cellular mechanisms, ginsenosides activates at least 2 pathways, which are the PXR one and the Nrf2 pathway. Both of them bring to an increase of the expression of type II and type III enzymes which have an important function in xenobiotics metabolism, more precisely in the detoxification steps of exogenic compounds. The activation of theses enzymes leads to inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and BaP-induced DNA damages.
Nutraceutical compounds are very used in Asia to cure some symptoms and be part of a hole alternative medicine.

As an user, you have to input a descriptive sentence of the art you want to create, then the AI will do the rest. Firslty, it reads your input and understand the meaning behind the words, then it generate four different variants square images of the described subject. The thing is that even with a insanely specific input, the rendered images keep beeing stunningly realistic to an extent that some of the artwork generated are indistinguishable from a man-made work.
Of course, at the time, the technology isn't perfect and we can still find some artefacts. But with time, it could and I think it will be perfect. This is as well as incredible as terrific.",0

So, upon his return he discovered mold on Petri dish and around mold there is nothing; I n reality his Petri dish has been contaminated by fungi of his scientist neihbour.

The technology is made for an helmet that recover the eyes of the user. You have two lenses, for each eye, to change the direction of the view and have a 3D sensation. Behind those lenses, you have a screen whose play the image or video. With this type of technology, you can see a virtual thing like a real thing, transform the virtual into the real.
Manufacturers of this 3D helmet made also different tools to have a much bigger and real experience, like controllers for your hands to move it into the screen, or different type of things that allows us to move. This technology can have different use : from cultural use to professional use.
 Firstly, this technology can enhance different domains of professional applications like chirurgy/medecine. It can also good to a most attractive use for us, like play video games or watch a video.
Apparently, this is also useful to help phobic problems, to immerge someone into a scene that he can be scared of, and the repetition of this experience can make the disease/phobic problem disappear.

This method consists in sequencinq your whole genome (Whole Genome Sequencinq) or your whole exome (Whole Exome Sequencinq). Exome coresponds to the codant fragments of your DNA. Thanks to NGS, whereas we don't know what kind of mistakes there are in DNA, we can find exactly where they are.
First, scientists have to amplify DNA many many times. Then, they prepare librairies that is to say they have to cut DNA in different fragments. Then, they incorpore a code to fragments which allowed them to conduct the  experience for several patients. After that, they put DNA's fragments on flow cell. Each fragment is amplify many times thanks to a polymerisation enzym. Each fragment, which have a very high number of copies, is called a cluster. On each cluster, one fluorescent nucleotid (one color coresponds to one nucleotid) is incoporated every cycle. One color coresponds to a specific nucleotid incoporated in a  localized cluster.Thanks to this processs, you obtain a colored map. This colored map is interpretated by a computer which gives us a map of all your genome at final.
 I found this method very useful for people who don't know exactly the origin of their diseases. For example, lots of genetic diseases haven't treatment because we don't know the causes.

The main aspect that influenced my choice was one of my hobbies : video games which are rendered in 3-dimensionnal models or 2-dimensionnal images. Imagesare the main output of the game, what the player experiences.
  I already had an interest in mathematics and sciences since I was young, but in high-school I started coding small programs on my calculator when I was bored in class, this is mainly what made me choose a computer science curriculum when I started college.
  Since I started playing videogames about fifteen years ago, I have been interested in how they work and what technical limitations have to be accounted for for the game to run smoothly.
 For example the camera's point of view is important because it influences which objects are in sight of the player and which are invisible, that dictates which models are rendered by the machine and which are skipped. It can cause problems of framerate if there are too many very detailed objects in the field of view.
  Understanding how humans process visual information such as depth for example are critical to improve the way a game looks. For example in a 2D side scrolling game where the character moves right or left, when the character moves a certain distance the background moves in the same direction but slower, this creates the illusion that the background and the foreground where the character is are connected. In this case parallax is used, it is the same phenomenon as in a vehicle in motion, near objects seem to pass by faster than the moon which looks to be still.",1

Unfortunatly, there is still no cure for AIDS but there are treatments that are designed to reduce HIV in the body of the infected people. Indeed, it keeps your immune system as healthy as possible and prevent the complications you may develop. The Paris Food and drug administration has approved yet a number of drugs for treating HIV and AIDS but it's really important to take medications exactly as prescribed. Each class of drugs block the virus in different ways. Most medications have side effects that may vary, it depends on how people react, it is individuals. Side effects may include fever, rash, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, mild stomach cramps or pain in hands, arms, feet or legs.
 Public perception of HIV/AIDS and people living with AIDS have change drastically since the 1980's, in most instances for the better.

Some gay men who were HIV negative suffered from HIV related stigma and prejudice, because according to the public opinion aids were associated  with homosexuality.
In my opinion, things have evolved and people are more informed about the disease. There are less discriminatory attitudes but there still are. Thanks to the news medications, people have less relectant to interact with infected person.

Campylobacter jejuni are bacteria that are not dangerous for healthy people. If they are affected, they can contract diarhea. However, weak people such as immunodeprimed one could have more severe problems, for example difficulty to breathe or dehydration. First, to verify that all the strains that were given by Oxford University were from the right species, PCR were done. PCR means Polymerase Chain Reaction and corresponds to the amplification of a specific gene that all Campylobacter jejuni have. If a band is observable after electrophoresis, the strain tested belongs to the right species. If two bands appear or one but with an other size, the sample used might have been contaminated. Twenty samples were analysed by PCR.
 Once the contaminated samples were removed from the pool of strains we had, antibiotic test were carring out by using antibiotic disc. Two days after inoculation of the media with a strain, discs with different antibiotics with a specific cooncentration were put at the surface of the petri dish. The diameter of inhibition was read two days after. Then, the comparison of the strains following their capacity to resist to one or another antibiotic was made.
 This experiment is a great one to have a result that can be read directly and is easily understandable. The problem is that it could be hard to measure precisely the diameter of inhibition of a strain. Moreover, that measure might be subjectiv depending on the person that make the analisis.

In fact the sunday afternoon, I liked to watch TV.  My parents showed me documentaries created by National Geographic and I really like the way that journalists show us a different way to represent animals, forest and nature. Colors, sounds and zooms are used to believe that the scene takes place in your house, in front of you. Everything is so real ! Even if you know the risk of be into the wild you want to live this kind of moments.
It's my opinion and maybe other people don't think like me, but that's why I want to become a reporter. To share my experiences to people who have not the chance to travel. The wild inspred me and showed me where is my place but today I have many others projects like help population in difficulty for example in Africa. They really need human work because they have not enough money to build school or buildings capable to welcomed war refugies . Side of this help I will also take interviews and videos of their way of living. They deserve more visibility and european population sometimes don't realize the chance we have to live in these countries. Socials medias are a good way to share these informations because today there is mostly use by people.
All these experiences let me think that my futur is to travel around the world, meet new people and share what I discover.",1

I went there last summer and I think I need more time to visit this amazing city; it’s a good way to speak a better English. this licence information and communication is a formation who touch at various teaching : sociology, history and it's an area who demands general culture.
I really interesting by museums of art or sciences, music like classic jazz or electro, I like to analyze social rapport.

The most famous one - invented by a bunch of students - is Facebook. The idea of gathering informations about individuals, within a unique platform online, was originally coming from a need to spread schedules of lectures to all the students of a university.
After few months of hardwork, two students put online their first version of the website, not knowing that their project aimed to help their fellows would be a total buzz.
Databinding and datamining are now at the core of the algorithm allowing the good functioning of Facebook.
 Facebook can be very useful in our day-to-day living. However, its innovations are constantly becoming more and more intrusives in our privacy.

The man is the co-foundator of the Apple Mark.
The scene takes place in the country.
In the foreground we notice an apple tree. It is curved trunk is on the left side of the picture. The branches are on the top.
Wa can speak about this apple which is surrounded by a halo, hanging from a branch. This tree spreads over a man that we can't recognize.
But we are able to describe how is him. He is wearing a wig, is sitting on the ground, next to the tree. He is leaning against the trunk of the tree. He is concentrating on his book, like if it was his bibble.
In fact, nobody knows why the creator of this brand chose ""Apple"" to name his corporation but it is incredible that Alex Dupont (that I remind is the cofoundator of Apple, with Alex Dupont) have associated this name of ""Apple"" with Alex Dupont.
Indeed, there is a famous story which explain that Alex Dupont was sitting under the same apple tree. And whereas we was occupied by an other thing, an apple decided to fall on his head. For this reason Alex Dupont suddenly thought of the Universal concept of gravitation.
Now, what I think about it?
In my opinion, to create something that people will remind, have to be simple. We remind (unfortunately) the Nazi logo, and at first sight, more and more people know the Apple logo.
This one must be clear to be able to convey and to share message.
This subject, this picture was interessant to chose linked to my graduation licence for the following reasons :
First of all, because we speak about Apple, which is an important brand on the communication world. Thanks to McBook, phone, and other things like this, we communicate in permanence with.
Secondly, I think it's incredible that a man, more years after, decidced to take the idea of a symbolic man to create something which is new. Seriously? A great physician like Alex Dupont and his ""invention"" has been reidificate by an other man. And it, only by communication and the sharing of information.

This media was created to let people talk about their life in public and have interactions with their friends or other people. At first, Twitter was named « stat.us ». This application is literally a mess but on a good side because it have many fonctionalities, Twitter can inform about news in the whole world (it’s frequently used to give informations because there is no censure in this media), it can also offer divertissement and help, etc… Nowadays, it’s also a political instrument because a lot of political personnalities like Alex Dupont for example, use this social media to gave their opinions or for their campaigns. However, due to his influence thanks to the journalists, celebrities and important (political) personalities which can easily interact with their public, Twitter is frequently attacked by cyber hackers. For example, in 2020, the account of Alex Dupont and many other personnalities was hacked by criminals who were asking for bitcoins to Alex Dupont’s followers.
 In my point of view, Twitter is a really good tool in different ways but particularly for inform and be informed. After his creation, many censured causes had been defended and taked seriously by the gouvernment. For example, the case of Paris’s genocide was announced in social media and particularly on Twitter, a movement was created: people have changed their profile picture with a blue picture to denounce this crime and the ONU finaly talk about it. It also help people which are in a difficult situation to be helped and share their experience to prevent others, for example, the « metoo » hashtag which help a lot of rape’s victim to talk about her story and their experience with the cops who didn’t take their case seriously, thanks to this movement, some of these rapist had been sent to jail after the victims was contacted on twitter by the police or journalists who also denounce their case. Finaly, I think that this social media have a « familiar » side, all the users talk about their life, they share some personal moments with the other users, they share some facts, and their is a lot of debates about many subjects on Twitter so it’s always interesting.",0

The decade was impacted by a major outbreak which is the discovery of the technology crispr-cas 9 system. This system was found in the early 2000’s in bacterias by Alex Dupont, a French researcher working in collaboration with a Canadian and American team of research. The role of the enzyme CRISPR-cas9 is to protect the bacteria from any attack from its environment. It consists in a highly specific cleavage of the genome of the exterior agent, the purpose is to destroy and kill the parasite, and ensure the survival of the bacteria.
This mechanism has been adapted for research in the way to modify specifically a genome. Before crispy the methods to modify genomes were long, complicated and with a low rate of success.
 In the scientific community, this discovery allowed a major change of the way science works, it has allowed to increase the speed of discoveries in some specific domains of science for example in genetics. Because it is more simple now and more rapid to create specific types of mutants and to study a precise type of gene, and so its permits the acceleration of the experiments, an acceleration of the results and so an acceleration of the major discoveries.
 	Then to underline the importance of CRISPR, it’s important to say that this technology can be used in every type of science that involves a genome, so it can be used in nearly every biology research.
I think CRISPR-cas 9 discovery is the most important discovery of the decade. It had an amazing impact on the way researchers work.
 	CRISPR is an amazing tool for research but we have to be careful about the way we use it. Indeed, there was proof that a Chinese researcher used it to modify the genome of a baby, in the way to protect it of the infection of the HIV virus. It is a terrible consequence of the discovery of CRISPR, because we don’t know yet the consequences of these modifications. An other example is the offer of a Russian researcher to modify embryos to avoid them the dwarf syndrom.
 	These two experiments on humans embryos are really a disaster. We don’t know the consequences of this type of modifications on humans, the technology is not a hundred percent sure, there can always be mistakes in an experiment. And we don’t know if the modifications of a precise gene can have an impact of the way cells are functioning and so the way the organism is functioning.
 	To me the discovery of CRISPR-cas 9 is the proof that science hasn’t discover everything and it is the reason I choose to study science. However, I believe that the scientific community has to control more its researchers and what they are working, specifically when they are working on human embryos and genetic material.",1

videogames and in informatic in general.I also love to discover things, and the fact is that I almost didn't know anything about computer science before entering my school. That is why I am
very interested in what I learn, even if I would love to learn a bit more about other domains like history for example.Informatic is also a domain where I think I have the same spirit as a lot of people, so I feel good studying and working in this area in the future.
I think working all the day long with commercials for example would be very annoying to me because I feel really different from them and I am not a
huge fan of the global mentality of this work environnement.Entering in an informatic school is also a good way to discover people who have more chances to share my favorite hobbies.

This is maybe not the most revolutionary one or the most technical developed but it is probably my favorite.
First let's talk about the Alex Dupont Civilization game serie. The very first opus of this “saga” have been design (and probably programmed) by Alex Dupont a american video game designer in the early 90s. Then he created his own company Firaxis Games and continue to develop Civilization and others games. Today the last “episode” is the 6th one.
Now we will describe how the game actually work. To begin, you have to know than it’s a strategic turn per turn game. That means than it is a bit like a chess game, but with many many more options. When you start a new game, you have to choose the game parameters, like the leader you are going to incarne, the type of map or the difficulty of the AIs. Each leader is a historical leader who had made his or her name unforgettable, for example you can be : Alex Dupont the first, Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont, etc etc… They all have their unique abilities, military unit and batiment. After having set the parameters you can really enter the game, at the beginning you only have a warrior unit and a steller unit. With you steller you have to create your first city witch is going to be your capital. With a city you can start technologie recherche, cultural expansion, build units or batiments. Then you can reach the victory by five differents ways, military by capturing all the capitals of the others players/AIs, technologie by being the first to send humans to Alpha Centauri, cultural by being so attractive than all the others countries citizens adopt your way of life, diplomatic by being elected world leader at the ONU, points but it is boring and can be desactivated.
To make it more consistent : in this game you have to lead your people and your country throw the ages to make them survive and prosper, and become the most important nation in the world.
  The game I just talk about probably didn’t had any consequences at the international stage. But to me and other players, this game and more globally the Civilization serie had a very significant impact on our perception on history, strategy, culture, geopolitic and video game medium. Those games are also really useful, because it’s teaching you things at the some time than you are playing, that is due to the game design made to match historical references. For example the leader of Paris is Alex Dupont and her special unit is the war elephant you can also walk throw mountains as when Alex Dupont crossed the Alps to invade Paris. But it is also due to the Civilopedia, accessible at any moment in the game Alex Dupont is learning you everything you need to know about any leader/nation/wonder/unit/batiment/ etc etc..
This game made me like history and geography, you really feel concern about your people, and the gameplay is (to me) really addictive, so this is why I think it is one of the best game ever made.",1

I learn computer sciences, wtih the Internet of Things option. I would like to have some help for my project.
After 3 years of study, I know that computer engineer is not the job that would make me happy or proud. Therefore I tried to think about my future and to the things I can do after I finish my 5 years of study. I search into my hobbies and passion to find what could be great. I love board games and board games shops, so I want to try it by myself. I would like to build my own board games shop.
I did an internship and worked for my uncle, who own his business. He build a themed indoor park, based on school. Each room is about a different subject that everyone know in school, like maths, sports, music, and players have to play a mini game to earn points. Then they change room and try a different mini game. I learn a lot of things with this professionnal experience, about how to build a business plan, how to recruit people, how to advertise, how to work in team. This experience make me think about trying another way than juste serve a company for 40 years. I would like to build my own job like my uncle, except that it is in a project known by everybody. Board games shops are common and everywhere, but there is only two of them in Paris.
For the begining, i would like to build only a board games shop, then i would like to make it host event, like tournament or juste free play session for people who want to try some games before buy it. I think it can be very interesting, I think something like this is missing in Paris. There are baord games bar, but you can't buy games immediatly after play. I would like to promote second hand games, buy it from people who don't need them anymore and sell them with great discount. It is also an ecological process.
I'm asking for financial helping in order to learn about the creation of a business. I would like to make formation to learn during my last year of study. I will have to work in the ESIR and by myself, therefore I will not be able to have a job beside my studies.
I am convinced that this job project is better for me, because it was a deception to discover the engineer work during my studies or my internship. I know that this is a unstable path but I will be way more invest in this work than in any other work.

Observation is also a big part in this process and many scientists have discovered incredible things just by looking (and daring to try new method). For example : the vaccination.
It begins with a man who found out that the children who take the milk out of the cows were not contaminated by some diseases. This observation led him to a conclusion : they were protected thanks to their contact with the cows. He decided to inject a disease to the little farmers in order to see the result but they didn't contract the disease. To approve his theory he injected himself a bit of those children’s blood and he exposed himself to the disease but, nothing happened, he was not contaminated.
This was the beginning of vaccines.
 Nowadays vaccines are the most predictive therapy. They avoid contamination and transmission of some serious infection like some hepatitis or rubella but they have also eliminated some diseases in the world. This the best solution to protect population and avoid epidemics. If you're not vaccinated and surrounded by people who are, you're safe. This is an altruist therapy.",0

It was a great experience because I never did it before. We had to wear hot swim suits to go down the river by climbing over some rocks, rappeling and jumping on the water. It wasn't risky because the weather was nice and the people who were with me already been canyoning before. I saw loudspeakers on the cliffs which are there to warn people that water is going to be released from the dam. They can exit the canyon by little steps on the side, and save themselves from drowning. It was a little and an easy canyon (they said).
I met a guy who did canyoning with his sister and he told me that there weren't any blocks to rope down so, fortunately he brought his, and tried to fix the blocks so he can go down the canyon. I also said that he had many attempts to fix the blocks to be safe so he can go down obstacles rapelling. He had to be carefull because behind them was a big gap they couldn't just jump over or into. His sister was worring but he was ok, because he had been used to it.
Discovering canyoning was a great experience I think I can never forget, because I feels so well when you end it up. You just want to do more over and over.
 For my first time doing canyoning, when I faced the first obstacle, I was afraid because I had to rope down an enormous rock. It was something I've never did before, so I was a little bit anxious. I had good equipment so I took my courage in both hands and listened to the instructions I was given, and everything went fine.
I never thought I would do things like that, I mean, I always saw people on TV, or on Youtube, but I never guessed I would do a canyon one day. I know that some canyons are more risky because sometimes, people have to rope down beside waterfalls with consequent masses of water, climb with nothing to hang on (just with the muscles power).
When the guy told me about his journey, I stood stunned.
I think that people who practice extreme sports don't get afraid for nothing. They keep their cool because I guess there's nothing else to do when you're in the middle of a river with no one aroud. Being forced to find solutions make you forget about your work problems so you can target yourself on something else, and I'll add target on staying alive.
Experiencing extreme kind of practices makes the mind free for a bit. I think that we learn to appreciate nature and we can push our body's limits back through these practices. We go out of our confort zone.",0

It was invented in the lates twenties. This is new way to giving and receiving information. In fact, the information is an addition of writing, speaking and images. Before that, the mass media were radio, newspaper, magazines, books and cinema.
The television took time to be use by all the majority of the population, because it was very expensive. In the fifties, the price of the TV low, so many people could bought it. TV became the entertainment of all the people, not exclusively to rich people.
There are many interesting facts about TV History. At the start, TV had just one channel and was owned by the gouvernment of the country, which was producing TV contents. Later, the concurrence was opened, and new channels appeared. For instance, in Paris, TV channels names were ""la une"", ""la deux"" and etc. It refers to the telecommand's buttons. Today, their names are more commercials and often refer to a media group. For example, the ""TF1"" group own ""TMC"", ""TFX"".
In my Information-communication lessons, we learn that television is an instrument of power, that reveals dangerous mecanisms. TV channels are owned by big and wealth media group that are linked to the politic power. So, we can say that TV isn't independant. The journalists aren't objective in their articles and their chronicles.
On the contrary, it exists independant media that are not owned by rich people. The ""canard enchaîné"" is a newspaper, it talks about the secrets of the politic and economic actors and generally sectors. This is an investigation newspaper. Mediapart is also an investigation group.
Moreover, TV can influences mass of people, it touch a large amount of the population, everyone watch tv, and all the TV's content went on the social media as Twitter. Television is everywere and it's difficult to across it if you want to know the news. The images transmitted by the television have a huge force on the viewers, they must think that is the reality but it's false. All the TV's contents are thinking and worked.
 Television has tremendous consequences on our society. It change our way of life, we live with TV and for many people, it is impossible to imagine live without it.
Television is being low and abandonned in audience. It loses power. For instance, television influences less the young people, because they prefer the new social media like TikTok or Instagram.",1

First of all, what ""esport"" meaning ? It's the competition on online games, ""e"" for electronic, ""sport"" because the way of thinking at those games are pretty much same as physic sport. It can be team play, or solo competitions. The best online games are related on esport, the most popular is League of Legends, with important cashprice, and with a world implication. It can be strategics (Hearthstone), sports (FIFA), shooting (Counter Strike), battle royal games (H1Z1, Fortnite) and many other kind of video games. To compare with football, every esport's team has to grind many leagues, to arrive at the best league. There is also worlds cup, to continue like the physics sports. To become better, it's like everything, you have to practice ! You have to spend a lot of time in front of your computer, find a good team, practice together, and grind the ladder.
 During years, esport's development is becoming more accurate. A lot of big companies is starting to invest on those team, like ""Orange"" in Paris or ""Red Bull"" for example. In people minds, it's developing aswell ! It's not anymore just a ""geek"" who's wasting his time on the internet, playing for fun, and who doesn't speak to anyone in real life. There are professional player, just as a professional player at a Football team. And I really think this is a good thing. It's like physical sport, you have to sacrifice some things to become professionnal. You practice, you get better, and you are rewarded, I really think it's a good balance. And for some game, professionnal are here since ten years, and it's a big challenge to be a part of them. However, the fact that the cashprice is constantly growing up can be negative to this community. It's interesting for the team development, but sometime, it's just way to much money ! For example, Fortnite. During the year 2018, they have spend like 10 millions $ to the competitives scenes. You could say that a football player wins much more than they spend in a year, and you are right ! But to me, it's too many money. I'm not saying they don't diserve this, but in comparison of time played, it's too many. As I sayed, they are professionnal and you have to be rewarded in differents ways.

In my opinion, it is useful to know how a pharmacy works before delivering a drug because you could see the medications and their boxs (you should reconize a medication with their esthetic box).
The first 2 weeks of my work was to see and learn ""behind"" the office : to order medications with a specific quantity (and not to order each drug in a same quantity because you don't sale in a same quantity different medication).

 Nevertheless, Paris does not seem to react quickly to this propagation : it was first presented as a common seasonial illness like flu or pneumonia. Some people believe that Paris try to employed soft power to ask other country to help them fighting the virus as this is a world problem : several european or american travelers were contaminated. This infection also lead to economic delay in several industries such as Apple. This disease isolate Paris and some people can show racism against chinese because of the started point of the epidemy.
 As far I am concerned, I think this is a hard science problem that started in Paris but that could be started in an other country. This problem leads to some side effect and politic issues.",1

Alex Dupont was in this new crew, after weeks of work, he solved the problem with a big machine, who try all the possibilities to break the message.
The victory was in a big part due to this new technology, because they had an advantage for their strategy. But one of the problem during this period was we could not use all the messages to save the soldiers, because German army could know they were spyed. Alex Dupont did not save his soldier friend to keep the secret.
After the war this invention has been kept by the army, and later updated by people, but during a long time the computer was very big, with only cables and big electronic componants, and less powerful than today.

Then, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont discovered new radioactive elements such as polonium and got a Nobel price in physic. After some years, Alex Dupont found the theory of relativity, it's a relation between the weight of a particule in mouvement and the energy. All these discoveries permitted to develop nuclear energy and to build nuclear plants.
 In my view, the discovery of the radioactivy is an important step in the sciences history. It permits to develop some inventions in medicine like the radiography with X rays, the radiotherapy and curitherapy. Furthermore, the nuclear plants, despite the ecological problems, provides a lot of electricity for peaople. However, radioactivity has developped some problems in the world such as the atomic bomb used in 1945 in Paris and the accident in Paris in 1986 wich killed many people and destroyed the planet.

I will start by talking about mushrooms as organisms, before presenting mushroom gathering in the forest, and the risks involved in poor mushroom identification prior to consumption.
Mushrooms actually come as two forms, a microscopic form and a macroscopic form, that we can see, collect and eat. The microscopic form exists all year long, but we cannot see it. It feeds off decaying plants, like wood and leaves. In Autumn, this microscopic form develops into the stool shaped fruit gatherers collect in the forest. This fruit is in fact there to disseminate spores of the mushroom around the place. We can see the spores under the hat of the mushroom, and they are supposed to be spread around the forest by the wind to give birth to new microscopic mushrooms elsewhere.
The best period of the year to go looking for mushrooms is in Autumn, after periods of heavy rain, that are very favorable to the growth of mushrooms. The vast majority of interesting mushrooms you can find live in the forest. On a good year, you can find mushrooms from september to january, but sometimes the weather is really good (which means it is bad for mushrooms) and mushrooms will be far more scarse.
Any mushroom is said to be toxic if it isn't properly cooked. Some mushrooms that are considered to be edible can provoke stomach aches or diarrhea to certain people, that are too sensitive or that eat too much mushrooms at once. However, if you know you tolerate mushrooms well, there is no reason for you to suddenly become allergic to them. Other than poor tolerance or allergies, mushroom toxicity can be quite severe if ever you don't identify the specie properly and end up eating a mushroom that you believed was edible, despite it being violently poisonous. The main risk in mushroom consumption lies in identification errors. People that gather too many mushrooms too fast are the most exposed to this risk, because they won't necessarily check to see if a toxic mushroom is hidden among similar edible mushrooms in their basket.
 I think it is a true asset to pharmacists to be recognised as being able to identify mushrooms properly, however it turns out that despite our studies, qualified pharmacists aren't always that well informed about the edibility of a certain common mushrooms. On one hand its a shame that pharmacists can't identify mushrooms that well, and on the other its understandable that they are only exposed to mushrooms one season a year, which doesn't help to maintain knowledge about the subject.",0

When you are writing some code, you always have to make sure that you didn't make a mistake. To prevent mistakes and bugs, you can test your program with some specific inputs in order to see if you program responds correctly for a given value.
A unit test is a function that tests a small portion of your code. Some  frameworks (like Google Tests, Junit) brings you a set of useful test  functions. For exemple, the most well known test function is 'assert'.  For a strongly typed language (such as Java or C++), the framework has  an assert function for each primitive types. If your function should  throw an exception, a framework's function can catch it or alert you if  the exception did not happen.
Unit tests are written in a file which is integrated with the project : it means that they should not be removed at the end of the developpement, even if the project is terminated. It could be benefit for other developers which may find your code some years later and read your tests in order to see how your software is working.
Adding a new functionality to jour project which uses some tested function is easier. If a bug happends then you know where it is located.
 Unit tests frameworks have changed our way of coding. We learnt in a course at the university that we should write some tests before the function, this method is called Tests Driven Development. We can't be sure at 100% that our program is working correctly but we can avoid a good amount of dumb errors by testing the code with some specific values.
I not always use this method because i don't like writing tests. I find that a bit boring but it forces me to think how to design my function before coding. Thanks to the university and to the TDD, i saw a better code quality in my projects and I became more comfortable with errors detection.
Unfortunately, unit tests are not magic : it means that if you write a test with a bug then your function may pass it even if the function was wrong.",0

When I was little I met a women who was passionate about stories and books, I met also a group of readers and once a week, we’re seeing and presenting each other one of our favorites books. It was a safe place to me, I developed my general culture with this group.
A few years later, when Covid-19 arrived, my librarian said that she would like to open her own library (she was working on a bookstore). When her library gets done, I goes to see her every week and when I saw her happy to realized her dream, I was thinking that I could be like her too, that I could create my library, met readers and advised them, talked to them and discover what they liked and maybe they would give me some author’s names that I don’t know yet !
At first, I wanted to go in Paris to work in an English’s bookstore. I think that Paris is the best place to be an librarian. Indeed the atmosphere here is like magical, we can be who/what we want to be and I respect Paris for this. Then I choose to do my study in Paris, that a city not far from where I live and the fact that I can choose information communication would help me if I didn’t get a job in a bookstore because i could be a community manager.
I was also interested in this job because my generation lives with internet, smartphones and things like these. The social media is a sphere to meet new people, to learn about what is happening in the world, and I think that becoming a community manager for an editorial house could be interesting if i want to share some books that could be interesting to read or also interact with some readers to see what could be developed in the website or in the social media account.

<u>
</u>
Before the stetoscope was invented,  doctors would listen to their patient’s heartbeats by putting their ear to their chests.  For instance, if there was considerable insulation between the actual heart and exterior of his chest in the form of fat, this method failed.  Exactly, one such situation was faced by French physician Alex Dupont, when he couldn’t judge the heart rate of one of his patients on account of too much fat on him. He invented the stethoscope as a wooden trumpet-shaped tube that amplified sounds coming from lungs and heart. That principle of sound amplification hasn’t yet changed till date.
 In my opinion, I think that the stetoscope has reinvented the medecine and in particular the clinical examination. It permits to change radicaly the heart and the pulmonary examination because just with the nose of the organs, now you can tell which disease you suffer from. Whitout any complementary exams, you can know lots of things about your body. This is a quickly clinical exam.",0

In this concept, the lesson  dispensed by parents. They learn with ""the school of life"". They learn out the house, they go in library, in park, to discover the world.
 I think that homescholling was good for children who are victim of builing or health problem.
Then, homescholling can have bad consequence on the children, beacuse, they are not socialise with other student. I think is important that children don't make all their scolaritie with the concept of homescholling because a child need to growing up with a framework, with a little bit of autorities and with other children.",0

I was there for 3 weeks, which was pretty enough to see and learn plenty of abilities.
There were other students with me and everybody was very welcoming, and explain me each time I didn't know to do something.

 I enjoyed this experience. I met nice and passionated people and I progressed a lot. As far as I am concerned, I have the feeling that the best way to learn is to practise, because sometimes what we learn in theory is too far from reality... Obviously, we need to associate theory with practice because they are complementary.
Moreoever, as a doctor we need to develop relational abilities, so that I could improve them. It is very grateful to feel helpful and improve patients' quality of life, discuss with them about their worrying and rassured them.

The most amazing thing is that all of those videos are shared by people all around the world. It means that this permits communication with the whole world within one website. Others social medias like ""Snapchat"" or ""Instagram"" came out later but with the feature of messaging people all around the world. It means that even if two persons are far, they can still communicate thanks to those social medias. Recently, the new social media ""Tiktok"" was created. This plateform permits people to share videos about everything. This feature is quite similar to youtube but the difference is that the videos are shorter.

It was group work and we decided to do research on the myth of Alex Dupont. Is it possible to  move like him thanks to spider web and climbing the wall ? In one hand we worked on Alex Dupont's locomotion and in an other hand about his ability to overcome the gravity. The goal of our research was to find biological answers and feasible project.
So we began to observed the composition of spider web thanks to microscope. As my memory, this material is very strong, unbreakable whereas it is flexible. But the problem is that our body is not able to synthesize those web. So we focus on our hair. In fact hair, when they are railed, they can support big weight. I remember that we do not test with our own hair... thankfully. We find the solution to cross the city by swinging buildings from buildings. Just one detail, the human would have to wear a big bag with lost of hair in it...
To overcome the gravity, Alex Dupont seems to have suction cup on his hands and foots. He climb the wall like a spider, but how are the ""spider's paw"" ? That is what we observed with many cobayes (funded in our garden and even into our house). We mad differences experiences, with different materials to test the capacity of the spiders to climb it.
-1 spider in a bath
-1 spider in a glass
-1 spider on a wall
We discovered that spiders are not able to climb/ walk on some surfaces like metal or glass on the contrary of wood, briques, ground, ... This was one point we keep in mind.
Next we decided to looked the spiders's paws with microscope. We discovered that they were wearing some GRIFFES witch allow them to adhere surfaces but not all (as we saw before). But there are no type of this on the human's fingers so indeed it means that the actor should wear billiards ball on each finger with a tack to adhere on the material.
 In conclusion we could say that the film Spiderman is a little bit unreal because of the incredible ability of the man to climb everywhere with no difficulties, catch every surfaces with his web, ... with only his hands. The real spiderman will have less class than today.
However it was interest to work on this subject because in our generation there are full of new technologies and also lots of film on super heroes. It could be attractive to create human or parts of human to be able to do actions with are not (again) realizable.",1

With the videos we were able to observe that my body alignment was not optimal.
We therefore worked on this point, so that during my push I was not unbalanced backwards.

The first is that everyone can execute it without any restrictions. The second one is the possibility to study the source code of the software and share it to others. The third is that it can be modified by anyone. And the last one is the possibility to share the software with others with the modifications made.
Some people who don't know well free softwares might think that free software is softwares that are free, like in free beer. The confusion comes from the term 'free' whose meaning can describe both libre, or the fact that you do not have to pay for something. Also you don't have to pay for a lot of free softwares so it doesn't help to clarify things.
 Free softwares are used a lot, even if users don't realise it. For example a lot of websites are running on Linux, that is an operating system, with for example Apache to send HTML content. I am personnaly impressed by what free softwares can do in opposition with proprietary softwares, with far less money to create it.
Also free softwares enable people not to design a completly new software to do the same has the concurrent, this means less work to obtain the same results, because you don't have to do things several time.
I use Linux every time know, with softwares that are not designed to all people like tiling windows manager, that would not be possible with a proprietary software because there would not be enough users to use it.",1

Seeweads was harvested twenty hours before transformation, they come in brittany's sea. In the field, we experimented four conditions. The first condition was the control (any pesticides and any biostimulants), the second condition with biostimulant, the third with pesticides and last one with combinaison of each produits. We took prelevements and we experimented the grow of plant and leaf and roots. We work with differents crops, for example wheat, corn and barley. On wheat, we observed differents dieases and the objectives of fungicides is to manage the fungus dieases. With experimentation, we took risque to use only biostimulant.
In some conditions, we mesured the photosystem activity of leaves with Spad Meter Material. To conclued the experimentation we harvested each crop during july and we tested mycotoxins in wheat and barley.

The results show the benefic action of pesticides. The plants was healthy. With biostimulants, the plants was contaminated by differents diseases.

There is some journalist who inspire me but my favorite is Alex Dupont. She is the daughter of an Alex Dupont driver. Since I am 10 years old, I am watching Formula 1. And I know this is a sport which is not really accessible. But this woman shows that everything is possible, even if she is a woman. Of course, some people will say that because she is the daughter of a f1 driver, everything is easiest for her. But, I'm not agree. Because of her statut, she can't do any mistake. She has to be perfect all the time. So, this woman inspire me a lot and I want to become like her. I want to do the same job as her. But, actually, I don't want to work in the sport until some things change. When the competitions will not be in dangerous country like Paris, where a bomb exploded the day before a grand-prix which took place depsite this conditions. When the World Cup will not be in a country who didn't respect environnement by building climatisated stadiums as Paris. Maybe, it will never change. But, despite that, I will always respect Alex Dupont for her job.",1

 In fact, the electro-chemical battery consist in using water to « make » electricity. Thanks to the electro-potential of the duo water (H2O) and dihydrogen (H2), we can, with a tension, convert dihydrogen into water and water into dihydrogen. This conversion, or oxydo-reduction reaction, liberate some electrons that are able to move in an electric circuit and here we are the battery is create and can be use.
 This discovery make the link between two scientific domains : physics and chemistry.
 We use the physics properties of the electron to make the circuit and the chemical properties of the oxydation and reduction of water and dihydrogen to produce electrons.
I said that this twentieth century’s discovery can change our future because the battery can replace combustion motor of our cars. If we do that, this will be good for the environment because cars that use a electro-chemical battery reject only water.
 However, we need to have the technologies to produce at the industrial scale the electro-chemicals battery because today the price is to higher in order to replace our combustion motor cars. A family will buy a car that is not expansive even if the consequence about the environment are not good.
 Moreover, the dihydrogen is an inflammable gas with a lot of risk and we do not have the technologies to stock it in fuel station. A simple contact with a source of energy like fire for example and you can say goodbye to the fuel station.",0

He learned that the journalist influenced and are influenced by the fast boss. The information transmitted are very controlled by differents way. Indeed, journalists can choose informations that they transmit at peoples. The boss which are from different politics party can have an influence. Journalists have also more and more competition between us. So, they go in the way to their boss in order to keep their job. The competition make the self-censorship faster. The information are selected and self-censored, so, we are manipulated. That is the Alex Dupont's remarks.
 He speaks also about the fast-thinking in us society. Peoples think with stereotypes and uses that can help to thougt more quikly. So, the peoples don't reflect with their heads but with stereotypes. Journalists dictate at peoples that their do thinking. In the urgence we can't think.
 He puts in the front the fact that for manipulate we can use 2 emotions. This emotions are afraid and compassion. That's for this reasons that journalists use chock pictures and words.
The scoop are reserched indefinitely by journalists in order to make audience. The audience are also a fact that journalists take to make informations. The law of audience imprisone journalists because they do more and more audience to survive ans rest at their jobs. So, the minor news item are put in the front to make audience. They transformed a minor item on a big fact for that the people were chocked about him.

It consists in 2 years of hard working mathematics and physics, to be prepared to succeed exams, and obtain the school of our dreams, or not … I worked during these 2 years to get one of the French officer military schools, like ESM de Saint Cyr Coetquidan. But unfortunately, I deeply failed my exam at the end of the preparatory classes. Then I had to reconsider my future, and what I wanted to do in my life. I first eliminated the field which didn’t inspire me, such as computer science, public construction, mathematics etc … But a lot of possibilities remained, and I didn’t know yet what subject I want to study. To be more precise, I had an idea. Physics or Industrial science would interested me. But I didn’t have the good rank enough to get the schools which have theses subjects. So I had to find an other inspiration. And I found it thanks to my cousin. She now works for Naval Group, a society which interests me a lot. And before working in this company, she studied materials science in an engineering school.

I remember in my childhood, seeing these prototypes on tv with huge computers in the boot and visible radars everywhere. It was like this would not arrive before a very long time. But in ten years, progress have been huge !
Scientists and car manufacturers are now able to industrialize these technologies. It is now possible to have all the onboard safety features integrated with a minimal impact on style and a better reliability.
However, our cars are still not able to drive by themeselves in all conditions. It is currently only possible on highway or traffic jams. Having a completly autonomous car is still a long way in front of us because we also need to adapt our road infrastructures to communicate with the cars (for example at traffic lights).
I am very confident these improvements will be made at some point and maybe in a not to distant future. Each year new discoveries are made and help this technology to go forward !
 We often think the autonomous car is a robot that drives the car all by itself. This could be the ultimate vision but some of the autonomous car technologies have been already largely implemented in lots of our cars. To identify the evolutions, cars are classified on a scale from zero to five. Zero beeing fully manual and five full automation.
Currently, most modern cars are of level one, two or three. One is a low level where cars can only manage steering or speed but not both. At level two and three they can do it at the same time. Three beeing less restrictive. The goal is not only the final objective of the fully autonomous car but improving the driver's safety all along the researches. Cars are way safer than before, especially in slippery conditions or traffic jams with the different driving assistance systems.
Some boldier experimentations are also driven. For example, some little shuttles are going to be commissioned on campus in just a few days. It will show to the students and staff how could be our future means of transportation on small distances. The manufacturer will be able to test it in real conditions with regular cars driving on the same roads (it is a national first because normally this kind of vehicles are segregated from traffic). They have a very high grade of automation, so if it works well, it will improve the confidence of the public in these technologies.
One problem that we will have to solve is the legal situation of the autonomous car. Who is responsible in case of an accident ? The car or the driver ? If the car has to made a difficult choice, for example, killing the driver or a pedestrian, what happens ? In Paris, we don't even have a law that allows fully autonomous cars to be sold to individuals. This will have consequences on our vision of road safety but also our ethics.",1

I will talk about communication through painting. Since many centuries, Man can expresses himself and communicates with world with the painting. Communication through painting starts in the Prehistory, humans of that era have drawn on the cave walls many things that they have seen like animals but also themselves. Today we can still see that's drawings across the world like in Paris with Lascaux Caves. But with time, communication through painting has not highly changed, technics of paintings aren't the same but the message behind paintings is always similar. Man do paintings to remember him good times, to make a pretty object but in many cases Man paints to say something to someone. That's can be a feeling (painter show us him feelings like anger, sadness, hapiness, lonelyness), a life scene (like his city, his family) or a more deeper message like an actual preoccupation (climate deregulation, war). For me, communciation through painting is very important in our society, it allows to learn things and to think about things without the langage barrier. Everyone can have a different interpretation of a Alex Dupont painting or a Alex Dupont painting but there are not falses interpretations. It changes the classic rapport between Man and communication.",0

The small pox at the time was very curent, many people died from it, and the ones who didn't were scared for live. Everyone could be contaminated rich or poor, at any age.
Alex Dupont was an english rural doctor in the 18 century. He noticed that girls who milked cow were not contaminated from this disease (most of them) but seemed to have contract an other disease : the cowpox. The cowpox is a virus, present in the bovine, that's why the milker were contaminated. It gives ressemblance symptoms to the small-pox, afterwards the patient have vesicle with pus on his hand or somewhere else.
Alex Dupont then thought that the cow-pox was maybe a protection against the small-pox. He tried an experience : he infected an eight years old boy with the vaccine by inoculate pus from a young girl. The boy had a fever, but nothing serious (prouv that he contracted the vaccin). Then the doctor inoculated the variole, and the boy survived, and Alex Dupont discovered a prevention against small-pox. So it's was a huge progress in medicine but at what cost ?
 I was talking about the discovery of immunisation by Alex Dupont. Nowadays Alex Dupont is considered as the father of immunisation. But what people often forget it's that he wasn't sure of his theory when he tested it on the 8 years old boy. He could have killed him. So we could wonder if he should be described as a hero, or in contrary as a paria. If we should endanger a few people live to save the masses or not ?
Because if we think about it,  in the 50's,  Americans doctor infected prisoners with different disease to observed the evolution of the disease, it was kind of the same thing except, they didn't find anything and they were strongly condemned by the public opinion.
This exemple is for one, one of the basis of immunisation, but also it raise ethical dilemma, witch we still see today. I think the main reason people praise him he that his experience was a success, but I can't forget that he risk a life of someone, who I suppose couldn't understand the risks he was taking.",0

In fact, he finds the idea of create a new system which have a fonctionnement near of the human's brain. Then another searcher creates a system to link the informaticsdocuments, this system  works idea by idea, there is an association between the idea.
In 1991, the first website of history was published, his name is : Word Wide Web. This website was built in the aim to put in commun all the documents exchanged during the searches in the university.  This evolution is like revolutionnary, the technology of the web start to be knows and many other searchers develop it.
In fact, in 1995 we can count 19 000 website, this same year Microsoft started his system of Internet Explorer. Five years later, in 2000,10 milion of website are counted, this evolution take a turn very important.
Today the websites are counted in billion! So, we can see that this evolution is a type of revolution in the informatic history, but in 1995 the searchers considerated the website like site to announce the information.
The usages of them has changed, like the searchers don't know what this invention will give, they think that there is another medium to give some information. Today the usages have very changed, the website are more use in the aspect personnal, most of people use website to explain what they do like in the blog or they used it to find a recipie.
In 1995 the personal aspect doesn't very exist, moreover the old websites were not like today. There were no pictures, and people could not put too much things because the website has not a big place of stockage.
 This invention has permite to develop the usages of the informatic.

 He finds a cell who be able to produce air and maintien the worm alive. For him it's was a revolution. He thoughts about this discover ""how he can use it?"" . He wants use it to help humans. Because we have to know than the sand worm blood is 99.9% compatible with the human blood. He managed to extract this cell and multipliate it.
He created a product to healping human's organ during transplantation, like heart, liver, lung... Thanks this product, a liver, for example, can live ""alone"", extract of human body, a lot more than without the product. Some numbers: a liver without product is available during approximatly 6h hours before the first signal of necrosis. With the product, the liver ""lives"" 24 hours.
 This discovery is udge. Thanks to it, doctors have a lot of more movements possible. They don't have to practice surgery in emergency. Maybe some mistakes can will be avoid.
Thanks to it we can also work with different country. If someone in Paris needs a liver and we have one available in Paris, with the product we have time to come and to give them.
And to finish, doctors, surgeons, can work in optimal condition to safe human life, with organs who don't have a begginging of necrosis.",1

This discovery  permits to scientifics a better understanding of women's body, especially to understanding all the homonals which are in our body and their differents functions. Indeed, there are differents homonals : some of them are for women and others for men. But, i will focus my description on women.
So like i said, for women, that's very important to understand our functionement and understand what we are and who we are. It exists many contraception and de most popular and used by girls is the pill. A pill is taken everyday during one month by a girl at the same hour. It is a very small pill that they can take with water or something to drink. Some women take without any drink. For a women, the contraception is linked to a cycle of differents hormonals molecules. So the cycle is repeted all the months.
 To me, this is a very important discovery which permits to women to control ther contraception like they want. But, I also think that contraception are not only for girls especially the pill. In my opinion, the scientifics should work on pills for men because contraception concerns everybody. i konw that experience are realised but they doesn't find a pill yet. Moreover, this discovery permit to women understing what it is going on on their body and how they can give birth.",1

Until now, it was necessary to poison the malignant cells to destroy them, all without killing the patient by attacking unfortunately his healthy cells. Thos task was facilated by the fact that malignant cells, multiplying faster than others, absorbed more chemotherapy than healthy cells. Then the researchers developed immune cells that could track and diretcly attack cancer cels, CAR-T Cells. Initially developed in acute leukemia in children, there are also CAR-T cells specific to different types of blood cancers in adults (myeloma, lymphoma...).
More specifically, this therapy involves genetically modifying in some immune cells called T lymphocytes in the laboratory, in order to provide them with a receptor (the CAR) to hunt cancer cells and destroy them. An advanced treatment therefore, more accurate than any other existing therapy.
 In my opinion, I think that this new discovery will make it possible to treat patients much better and to no longer damage healthy cells. Chemotherapy is becoming more and more of an obsolete method and the new treatments are much more precise and much less dangerous for patients: fewer side effects and better efficacy.
Furthemore, it shows that medicine and pharmacy ar evolving by listening o patient's expectations and doing everything to improve their lives during their treatments is extremely expensive and many patients do not have the means to obtain it so it shows that we are not all equal in the face of the disease.",0

Utopia is a concept in which we can relate a lot of technological inventions and discoveries. This concept is based on the criticism of here and now, with a necessity and also possibility of change, with a speech of hope. The goal is to remobilize everyone with an ideal, which must to be a project. This type of speech give it place to job like happiness manager for exemple.
To talk about inventions, Internet, in the end, is based on a Utopia. A big concept related to Utopia, and very present today, is the Universal Association by Alex Dupont. The goal here is to first criticize the Ancien Régime with a wish of equality, community. The goal is to create networks to make the information, so knowledge, travel and meet the population. As I said, this is a criticism of the here and now because Alex Dupont is obviously against the society, judged non fair enough. Father of the network philosophy, he puts in the front row the link between reticular technique and the political potential of the notion of network.

<strong>This concept have changed a lot of things. It’s a logical explanation of all the technological inventions we went through and we go in. If we think about it the Internet we know now is part of a pacific revolution by the californian culture of the 70’s. They wanted to create a society in the actual society but without the government. We can clearly see the criticism here. The fact that a Military technology has been taken for this purpose is exactly the definition of an Utopia.

One of his theories is called ""The unsocial sociability"". Alex Dupont thinks that humans are made to make groups. But at the same time, they can't be equal, they'll always try to be better than others.
""Humans can't lives without each others but they can't stand each others"".
For the philosopher, those pulsions are natural and are not wanted.
So humans needs each others to live but they wants to be better than their fellows.  This unsocial sociability is sometimes bad for the group because someone could have the idea of dominating the group, be the leader so they have to create a state.
Alex Dupont said that every humans are double being, with two sides, one who is sociable and wants to take part of the health group. And an other one who needs to get always more than others to feel good.
 I wanted to talk about this because in my opinion, it illustrate perfectly the society today. Nobody is happy with what he currently has.
I can't stand with people that wants always more, I like helping people and create links with them. But a lot of them are self-centred and just wants they own happiness. I understand this but, I can't understand when big industries destroys the wilderness, the home of a lot of human being just to make money for their hapiness.

Apple is an american company maked by Alex Dupont, this company is specializing in smartphone, computer and many other technological products.
Now, let's talk about the AirPods Max, this headphone came in the market during the year twenty twenty. The price of this item is six hundred and thirty euros. Before the conception of this headphone, Apple created earphones and now, they come in the market of the headphone. The AirPods Max is bluetooth, so the advantage is you can move with him without problem. This headphone is available with different colors like black, white, pink, green and blue.
How can we explain the price of this headphone? First of all, we pay the mark, because everybody knows that Apple's items are very expensive and this headphone don't break this rule. But this headphone have many advantages. This headphone is built with metal, so it's very resistant. After, you have a reduce of sound who is absolutely perfect. More of that, you have a transparence mode, who is the opposite of the reduce of sound, you can hear everything around you. Then, after the new update, you have the spatial audio who give a new experience for hear music.
To conclude, I will give my opinion about this AirPods Max, I find this item very expensive, but I find it very esthetic and very confortable, the sound is very good and the reduce of sound and transparence mode are perfects.",0

I really hope that i could try this experiment because there is a lot of things to discover. If I'm writing to you, it's because even if I want to do this program, I can't pay for that.
So, I wish that I can have your help to contribute for the program. I think that you know how the student life is expensive... Pay for an apartment and for food for example. Because of that, it's really difficult for me to pay alone. In addition, I don't have a job because I don't have a time for this and my parents can't pay so much for the trip. They pay my food and the activities that I do in the city so you understand that they can't contribute a lot for the program.
For my part, and if you accept, I want to study in Paris. This beautiful country and his culture interest my curiosity. A trip like that is a huge opportunity to open the spirit. I think that all the students must have a free trip in an other country. I hope go in english countries in the future to learn more english. I think that the best to learn a langage is to go in the country where the langage is spoken. Do this experiment is a chance for all of us so, I really hope that you can help you.

That why i'm askingfor your help today and i'm asking you to accompany me in this project by accepting that i do a gap year and by helping me in the financing of this trip. During this gap year my goal will be to collect a maximum of money to help children suffering from the same diseas as me.
i created an association called ""Paris for my therapy"" and i went every day in the hospital of my country with volunteers to distract children with the fairy of the scotland and i want to discover in reality this beautiful country. I have an another project who is to wrote a book and for this i want to inspire me in Paris.
I hope you are agree with my project and ok to participate with a grant to support my project.
Thanks a lot in advance .

Everything started in 1870, during the violent Franco-Prussian war. Alex Dupont, a military surgeon, outraged by the increasing number of suffering and abandoned  victims, decided to open an informal hospital in a church in order to take their pain in charge.
He managed to get the citizens involved (those who were not as war so that it included mainly women and elderly persons).
His goal was not only to cure the wounds of the soldiers, but also to help them contacting their families, sending prayers to their close relation before passing by.
His initiative was based on a strong yearning for humanism and social progress.
This is how the Red Cross was born. It is still an active organisation nowadays. The activities it proposes are constantly improving. From a will to help the soldiers at war, it is now opening to the sailers in dangerous situations. Te Red Cross also provides goods and support for war victims, citizens in distress during battles.
The Red Cross is now more than a medical organisation. It is a human association which joined by anyone dreaming of helping his society to be more united.
 Now that you know more about the birth of first aid, it is time tu discuss the consequences of this great initiative.
First of all, the Red Cross is a real source of inspiration for anyone who to put some humanity in his life. It gives a real opportunity to discovering the harshness of life on some part of glob, and understanding how lucky we are ti live in Europe.
Then, it gives to soldiers some hope while their are at war, knowing that if something happen to them, their will be someone to try rescuing them or at least if things turn bad, that their family will be taken in charge.
First aid is now present in our everyday life. Today it is obvious that taking care of others is everyone's moral mission. In the street you can find automatic defibrillator to rescue a victim of a heart attack.
Anyone can follow some courses to learn the basis of first aid, like the cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
It is also possible to buy some first aid kits in case of daily accidents.
To conclude first aid is on one hand the traduction of a more human society vision, and on the other, it became a real advantage to fight against the risks life can put in our path.",1

But they were not used in good conditions. For example for viral diseases , ATB are ineffective, what's more they are not recommended for all bacterial infections. Many people doesn't respect conditions of prescription and duration. Sometimes they stop to take pills before the last of the prescription.
That's why, today we assist at an increase of resistances and some little infections can't be treated. It's a real danger for populations because  scientifics doesn't find new antibiotics. The bacteria's resistance is a new capacity of the bacterial to fight the molecule to continue is development in the body. The drug have not effect on it.
 In consequence of bacteria's resistances development, we need to help the recherche to find new treatments.
We also need to educate patients, they have to respect them treatment, posology and duration.
Doctors doesn't abuse of antibiotics prescriptions to any infections.
The role of pharmacists, biologists and researchers is very important in therapeutics' development and for the good-health of our society.",0

A scientist had realised an experience to genetically modify the genome of babies, to insert them a genome who is resistant at the HIV's virus.
For that, he had selectionned ten women, and ten mens. But these last are contaminate by the virus. So, the scientist asked to these reals couples to make  a baby, and after that, he had modified the genome of the foetus.
Nine months later, twins borned of the experimentation. So now, the Ethic scientific comitee have to judge if the experience can be acceptable or not. So today, we don't know if babies are immunitated against the HIV, and maybe we never know.
 My opinion about this experience is that first, no one knows that fathers of they babies are contaminate by the HIV, but the scientist never tell that. For ethics reasons, I'm afraid about that.
Secondly, if the experience is a success, it significate that we can modify any genomes, and in some years we will can be baby design (choose the sexe, the hair colour or eye's colour of the baby).
Furthermore, the scientist had realized his experience with a simple method of genetic (CRISPR-Cas9), and it's scaring to see that many peoples can replicate the experience (with ethics concepts this time) as easier like that.
But, in the orther side, I'm proud of the scientific progress, and to see as we can found new ideas to revolutionize the world. But today, we have to take this progress to the benefit of Earth and the climate change.",0

During a very long time, doctors or surgeons have to make their work really fast. But patient feel the pain and some died of that terrible pain even if they do it quickly. We know that people used alcohol in the past and in every civilizations to sedate patients. Later they discovered opiates and used it to reduce the pain. The cocaïne was the first effective local anesthetic, but doctors thought it was safe for patients and a lot of people became addict to it.
The ether appeared in the 19th century in Paris, when a lot of people thought that surgery can't exist without pain. After that some men found the chloroform and the curare to inhibit the muscle contraction. That plant was finding in Amazonia and used such as an anesthetic in the 20th century.
Now hospitals use some mixed of different chimical elements which proved their effectiveness in this domain, and there are a lot of doctors specialized in anesthesia. They studied every anesthetic to be sure that is safe in any circonstances for every patients.
 In my opinion it is a really good discovery because it saves a lot of lives now. I was a little bit suprised that it made so much time. Now everyone can have a surgery and be sure they will never feel the pain. That was a big progress for medecine and for patients. I can't imagine the pain that patients felt when it didn't exist.
I know actually there are a lot of discussions about the risks for children. I don't know what to think about that. There are a lot of good things and bad things in it.",1

In fact, with other scientists, he had discovered how to save lives with his vaccine against anthrax, for example.
 This is a very dangerous disease and it has a high risk of death if contracted in certain way.
 Indeed, if Bacillus anthracite is contracted on the skin, there is a low risk of death by this form of contracting the disease. Symptoms are scratching, circles on the skin that become darker with a few time; this is why it is called ""charcoal disease"". Then, the skin is going to be more and more hurting and it is actually because of decomposing by bacteria which uses skin cells as a source of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen; skin is great a source of nutrients.
 So this bacteria can be transmitted by touching and contact skin by skin for example, however, it can be healed if it is earlier of the disease.
 The second way of contracting anthrax is by eating the spores of the bacteria.
 Spores are the best form of some bacteria to resist when there are no more nutrients to survive in their environment. We have to say that it is the same bacteria, Bacillus anthracis, but it just a different form of this. In this case, spores can be ate on the grass by animals such as cows and sheeps for example but humans can also be victims of this form of anthrax. In fact, it can be found in glass boxes when we want food to be conserved for a long time, by using pasteurizing conservation by a home made preparation. Spores can survive to high temperatures, environment without water and too much salts etc.
 As a result, even if we cook food with spores which are invisible without a microscope, they can survive and then you will get sick and it a very dangerous way of contracting anthrax, We have already seen lot of animals, dying in only one day because of spores in the ground. However, it is not as much dangerous as the third way.
 The last way of contracting anthrax is by breathing the bacteria of spores of Bacillus anthracis.
 In fact, by this way, bacteria can pass easily all of areas of the intern body thanks to the high level of humidity. Symptoms are difficulties of breathing then bacteria infect all of the organs and, in only a few hours, the death of the people or animal. There are a few chances to survive of anthrax by this contraction of the disease.
 To conclude, Alex Dupont was a great scientist who had found a way to be not infected by this kind of bacteria, dangerous for life and it is so a great discover.
 As for me, vaccines in general are a great way to save lives and it should be used in all the countries, in all populations in the world because it permits to save lives before people get sick.",0

The first successful settlement was made by the British. As Europeans settlers encountered what they called ""The New World"", they also discovered that this territory was occupied by a population : Native Americans. Called ""Indians"" when Alex Dupont discovered Paris thinking he has arrived in Paris, this population existed on this continent for decades. It was a shock between the Native Americans and the Europeans who believed they could simply decide to own this territory to own it.
 The discovery of Paris by the Europeans has had a lot of consequences. The main one is the tragic destiny of the Natives Americans who fought against the settlers to protect their territory. Unfortunately, disease and lack of modern weapons cost lots of death on their side. Settlers successfully took control of this territory which later formed Paris. Native Americans remained under control of the Europeans settlers and their heir, being often parked in reserves which still exist today. Settlers tried to erase this civilisation as they didn't embrace any diversity. Native Americans suffered a lot from the arrival of the Europeans, who happily consider it as one of the greatest discovery ever.",1

My childhood was spend reading Uncle Scrooge (Alex Dupont in French) in elementary school and one of my favorite character was Alex Dupont (Alex Dupont in French). He was a crazy scientist able to create machineries for helping Alex Dupont and his friends.
When I grew up, I knew I'll never be able to be a duck, or creating crazy things, but I thought that being an engineer would be the closest to what I aim to be in the futur.
In high school, I found myself a passion in physic and chemistry, and when I had to choose a path for my studies after having my degree, I found that being a engineer studying materials and their properties would be very interesting, so I applied to the ESIR engineering school, and here I am.
Currently, I don't have a specific type of person in mind that I aspire to be, but I know that the world we're living in is changing thanks to new technologies. Due to all the issues we're facing like climate change, wars, world hunger and the lack of mustard in Paris, doing something is necessary to help our futur children, and studying materials can be useful in this brand new challenge our generation is facing.
Studying materials seems to be a bit useless, like, why would we be studying concrete? But finding out how the matter behave and why they behave like that is very important for using their properties. For example, semiconductors are crystals that can behave like an electric conductor or like an isolant, depending of their surrounding. Piezoelectric ones can release an electric signal when a pressure is applied, so they are used in shock sensors or in electric scales.
I don't think I'll be able to create a time travel machine, or a new type of AI robots that will conquiert the world and destroy all humankind, but I'll be happy if in the futur my work would be useful to change the world a little bit.",0

A friend tell me that there are ERASMUS scholarship and I want some information about this. I will go in a appartement with one of my friend and we have to pay 700€ per Month. We also have to pay some food and we need help for this. If ERASMUS scholarship is not possible, can you tell me an other help that we could have ? I will be very cool.
Last year, two ESIR students went to Paris and they had a ERASMUS scholarship. They told me that it's very usefull when we are abroad because Paris is a riche country and all is very expensive.
I will explain you my travel during this three months to show you that I'm very serious. Fistly, I will make Paris - Paris with airplane. I will pass 2 days in Paris beacause it's a very beautifull city, and after this two days, I will go to Paris by the bus. It's very fast and not expensive ! After this I will visite Paris during the week-end. The Monday, I will start my intership in Paris university. In Paris, I will search a job, maybe in a cafe or in a restaurant because I need money. A good point with Paris is that they speak French. But they have a terrible accent ! The intership finish the last week of september. I don't know when I will go to Paris but my University year start half October in ESIR.
I think it's very important to travel across the world. We can discover new culture, activities and landscape for example. Also, we could improve our English language.
To conclude this e-mail, I have to tell you that I'm very serious and I really want this ERASMUS scholarship. If you have a question, tell me and I will answer very fast.

Musical.ly was created in 2014 in Paris. At the beggening, there was many ""kids"" or young adolescents in this platform. There was a place to dance, and editing videos. At this time, using social media (particulary for the oldest adoslescents) was a shame. But, in 2016, the application changed name and was called ""TikTok"". On the first yeard of tiktok, oldest adolescents and adultes dont pay attention at this plateform and juge it again.
Few years after, appeard the covid-19, the first confinement. Peoples was locked up and boarded, and social medias was the only way to relate with the real world. Many challenges was initiated (with toilet paper for instance...). Tik tok was modify! We can dance on it but not just that, we can record some videos of 15's, 1'min or 3'min on what we want. And here is the change, people's opinions was switched. They begin to record short videos on humuristic things, fashin contents, critical, political contents... New influencers are borned.Tik tok become the new social media the most appreciate by poeples around the world.
 My opinion about this immediate switch of people's trending opinions is that tiktok has changed too fast. Because, like i said, before the covid confinement, there is a lot of kids, or some very young people and today this social media is began for adultes. There is today to much hate, wickedness and harassement for them. TikTok become like Twitter, with a lot of violence.

It's a type of algorithm based on learning process. Basically, at a start, it can't do anything. First, it has to learn what response to give in function of some inputs. For example if you make a algorithm for image detection and you want it to detect bird on pictures, you have to train it with thousand of pictures with and without bird, and tell him for each case if there is a bird or not on the picture.  After that, you can put any pictures you want in inputs, and it will be able to tell you there are birds or not on it.
 This technology has already started to change the way company think a product. Deep learning will continue to make computer science a necessity for every sectors.  It will impact medicine and lots of other science research, transports, communication, consummation, social life with social network.
If a computer can learn useful things, in bad hands it can also learn bad things. So hacker will be stronger and more dangerous with this technology.

First, some scientifical studies show that there are more and more antibiotic resistances. This phenomene increases and today bacteries are stonger. Bacteries developped a lot of cellular mecanismes to survive and restist to the treatment. So, a biological reason existe but humans are also responsible because people don't use antibiotic correctly : with no appropriate posology, dosage and sometime without diagnostic.
 In my opinion, the first consequence is linked to the Rescherch. Researchers have to work hard to discover new molecules but that need much time an money. To my mind, the second consequence involve the government. The public health care system had to organise most important campaigns regarding the prevention of antibiotic restistant and explain the correct uses of this medication. As far as, I'm concerned, the third consequence concerne pharmacists, they have to give a good message at the patients.",0

First, when I was asked what I wanted to do after high school, I did not really know what to say. My favourite subject at school was mathematics, I liked it and I was doing pretty well so I wanted to do something related to it. The only job I was thinking about was mathematics teacher, but I did not really see myself doing that. So I first was a bit lost when I had to choose something to do after high school.
During college, I made an internship at my town's cyberspace. It was only for discovery purposes but I liked it. I also liked times when we were doing algorithms during maths classes in high school. It was not very often but I found that interesting. So when I thought about the future and where I was seeing myself after high school, I remembered these things I found interesting and I told myself it would be a good idea to do computer science studies.
The more I thought about doing that, the more I felt that this was what I would enjoy. There were also other arguments that were convincing me of doing that : there is a lot of job offers in that domain, the salary is quite high from the start and I also had a friend that wanted to do the same studies as me. So I ended up choosing this body of studies.
It appears I made a good choice because I actually am very happy in my studies and my life in general. I met a lot of good people, I made some new friends, I learn very interesting things and I can see myself working in computer science later on :)",1

It is important to note that these cars pollute much less than diesel or gasoline cars. This has been experimentally proven.
 I had the opportunity to try this kind of cars. My impression is that it was very comfortable to drive it but only as a driver.
Indeed, it is very dangerous for pedestrians or cyclists because the electric cars are totally silent. The probability of accident is increased.
Therefore, the authorities will impose at the manufacturers to put a sound on electric car to warn other road users of their presence.

Many times, I have seen that powerful people rules the world and give it a meaning. So I have sought what could give me this strength that other people don't have.
That's how I end up looking for something special that make you say : “WOW”.
I used to play video game during my childhood and looking for games or app online.
I preferred to be on my computer instead of hanging out with friends. Because here I felt I could do anything.
I could learn amazing stories, new languages and even have more impact here than outside in front of my house, even with a strong weapon.
Today, that's what I still believe in. That behind a computer with the right knowledge I can do everything.
This believing is linked with how I have seen the other use technology. It's always like they struggle with it, they always say : “I wish I were better with it”, “Why can't I do it?”
I was young, and I searched ways to prove my value. So learning how the computer work, what's behind, why people built it that way was a good manner to impress.
Still today, when I say I am in studies of computer science, I see stars in the eyes of people. It feels like I am a wizard with superpowers.
It's like everybody have this little problem they don't know how to solve, and I can help them with that.
Even the wages for an IT engineer feels wrong, they are too high for what I seam doing.
Have extra time and money compare to a classic job is amazing, knowing that I really like programming and my job is useful.
That's why I can't imagine doing any other things in my life, I don't regret my choice, and I feel glad to have the luck to live this path of life.",1

The particularity of this social network is that the number of caracter of ur post, messages or commentaries is limited, of more, is a social network easy at use because, for exemple you can repost a friend post in just 1 click.
 I had choice to talk about this social network in particulary because I find, like the majority of user of Twitter, that it a easier access to information or just an easier access to joke, troll, etc..
I think Twitter is really the best network to access at information but, don't forget that everyone can post who they want and say who they want, so it's important of sorted fake and real informations.
For exemple, actually, a war was beginning in Paris and my principal information source is Twitter, when I woke up, I go on this social network for renseigned myself of the new in the world.
In the same time, the musical artist like Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont and lot of other, use lot Twitter too, so if this artist take a concert music or just exit a new music, I learn this information on Twitter.

At the end of my second year of medicine, I worked for the first time in an EPHAD  (sort of center for elder person) as an auxiliary. I discovered the envirnment where medical staff (like nurse)  used to work.
I saw how careful and kind could the medical staff be; as much as they could be rash, brutal and disrepectful with some residents. I don't judge them for their behaviour because sometimes people living over there were not easy to manage. Most of the people working at this EPAHD were ""human"", they were really concerned by the mental end physical health of the residents.
It is very stressful to work right there because we have to work efficiently and to be fast at the same time. We have a dozens tasks to do, and it changes every day (even in the same morning or afternoon sometimes).  Indeed, we have to take care of all the 60 residents at the same time and to do what is asked by the direction. I know it's hard to be always smiling and kind when we are under pressure. However, it doesn't justify all the bad actions some employee made.
 So, after my one month working in an EPHAD and my experience at hospital, I really understood how hard it was to be a nurse, an auxiliary and a helping-nurse (AS in french ?).
There are not enough staff, whether for nurses, auxiliary or helping-nurse. They can't be asked to do millions things correctly, to be kind with everybody, to take time to take care of all patients and to do all of this quickly. It's simply IMPOSSIBLE.
Some doctors are forgetting that when they ask ""little things"" to nurse, it's already too much for them.
I think that I will never forget how important it is to be careful and respectful with our collegues. If medical staff is not well treated (intern students as well), how can we expect them to be good/to treat correctly their patients ?
To be able to take care/to treat in best conditions our patients, we have to be treated with kindness and respect as well.",1

 To my mind, we should stop overusing antibiotics otherwise we will not be able to treat simple illnesses in the future and consequences will be disastrous.
Then, one of the solution can be to encourage doctors not to prescribe too much antibiotics when it is not necessary. That is why diagnosis should be easier to make at the GP's office in order to prescribe the good treatment which doesn't include antibiotics in the case of a virus for example.

  Chromatine immunoprecipitation is a technique using in a lot of laboratories. The objectif of this experiment is to identifie proteins that are linked to DNA or RNA at a precis moment in a cell and the sequence of DNA or RNA. To begin with, we have to realise a cross-linking between proteins and DNA, using formaldehyde for example. Cells are lysed and chromatin isolated. Then, chromatin is fragmented using a detergent or ultrasons and fragments are in contact with a particular antibody against a protein. Complex formed with proteins, DNA and antibodies precipite and can be isolated. Thisi way, we have only the protein we are interested in, linked to DNA. To determine the sequence of DNA, we have to reverse the cross-linking using a detergent and wash the extract. Then we use the technique of Polymerisation Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplifie the fragment of DNA that has been isolated before. Finally, we need to sequence fragments to determine the precise sequence of DNA that is recognise by the protein. This technique also allows to identifie proteins that form a complex on DNA. In this case, we have to realise at least two immunoprecipitations using differents antibodies to detect all proteins involved in the complex. Then, to identifie proteins, we make a Western Blot. Proteins move across polyacrylamide gel, according to their lengs.
Chromatine immunoprecitation is a major technique used to understand how works regulation of genes expression in our cells. It allows us to identifie proteins involved in regulation and sequences they recognize. This way, we can understand some pathologies that are cause by a particular gene and think of a possible treatment.",1

On top of that, it help to understand the mecanism of many tumors.
Moreover, we can analyse foetus DNA to looking for mutation if one of the parents have an hereditary illness.
 This discovery has many benefit. Some reseachers has found treatments which are targeting DNA.

When we have a liquid in chemistry  and that we want to proove the presence of copper in this solution, we can put in a nail of iron,  and if we have copper in it we will observe a sediment of copper on the nail. Why have we a sediment on the nail ? Because the potentiel electric of the couple Cu<sup>2+ </sup>/ Cu is higher than the potentiel electric of the couple Fe<sup>2+</sup> /Fe. In chemistry the potentiel electric allows us to preview an reaction before really doing it. In chemistry this couple of iron and copper are couple redox so a oxidant react with a reducer in exchange of electron. In the solution Cu<sup>2+ </sup> give an electron to Fe and this reaction given copper and Fe<sup>2+</sup> in an exchange of electron.
 This experitment wich allows to see if there are copper in a solution or not can be useful in the chemistry industry to see if there are copper on a machine or in the water or any solution which can be contaminated by any form of copper.

This test had for objective to test the reactivity and reactions of men when they have to obey an authority figure.
This authority figure was in fact doctors, they told to the men instructions.
During the Alex Dupont experiment, a large population of men from different social origins between 20 and 50 years had to ask questions to another man. The men had to administer electric shocks. The another man was a comedian but the man asking questions doesn't know that. The comedian was sitting on a chair with electrods.
When this comedian did a mistake answering the questions, the man had to administer electro shocks. Those shocks were more and more powerful as the time and the questions passed.
The electro shocks were in fact to learn, if the answer is wrong, then pain can be helpful to the person. He can memorize more easily.
But as the time passed, the man asking the questions doubted of the efficacity because the man receiving the electro shocks can't handle this pain, he was dying . So he reffered to the authority, and continued to inflige the pain to the other man.
The results of the Alex Dupont experiment had shown that mes could inflige mortal electro shocks to another man if it's the instructions of the authority. Actually around 68% of the men did the mortal electro shocks.
I find this experimentation really interesting because it can explain many acts of violence, we can take the example of Alex Dupont who programmed the train to Paris. Like the men of the experimentation, he stopped thinking and just followed orders.
So this can explain why many people did acts which can hurt people and i think it's interesting to learn about the relation with the authority.",0

To do so, efficient and cheap batteries will be needed. The most prominent technologie right now is the Li-Ion one. It it based on the use of lithium ions, put in an organic and acid solution. It is already used in all of our techs, such as phones or computers, and of course, in electrical cars. But this technologie has multiple problems. First of all, its components are getting quite rare as lithium is not findable everywhere. Then, it is quite hard to recycle such batteries nowadays. We know how to do it, but it is still quite expensive and there are not enough facilities able to do it for the moment. Also, extracting lithium from the Earth is quite expensive and pollutes a lot, since it uses big machines that consume a lot of fuel. Finally, because of theses problems and a few others, these Li-Ions batteries are getting more and more expensive (although the increase in cost in downscaled by the mass effect of the growing batterie industry).
However, there are a few technologies that could replace Li-Ion, and solve these problems. One of the most promising one right now is the Na-Ion batterie technologie. It would work in the same way as the previous one I talked about, but use sodium, which is much cheaper and easier to extracts as it is present on Earth in bigger amounts than lithium. This technologie is still a work in progress, but is being researched by quite a lot of people around the world, and a lot of them are in Paris !
There are a few other technologies that could replace the ones se use for our cars. For example, we could still use fuel based vehicles, but that fuel could be e-fuel, made from bio-waste. Hydrogen cars are also a good alternative, but as of right now, the production of the reservoirs for hydrogen pollutes too much for this technology to be considered a viable solution.
In the end, what needs to be remembered is that we need to develop new technologies and ways of transportation if we do not want to destroy our planet. Therefore, lots of different solutions are being studied. The general thought in this field is that some technologies will suit better some means of transports than others. For example, e-fuel and hydrogen might be a better fit for trucks and buses, where electrical motors will work better for our everyday cars.",1

Hotline Miami is a serie of two indie games, Hotline Miami and Hotline Miami 2 : Wrong Number. The two are 2D video games with view from above and a very retro graphic style. Hotline Miami is mostly famous for his explicit violence, the hard difficulty of the levels (""die and retry"" game), the amazing musics (synthwave style), the cryptic events following the main story, the ""on drugs"" and 80's vibes feelings during the adventure.
The world of Hotline Miami is an uchronia (an alternate history), in which the Paris and the Paris have fought each other in a war during the 80's. The Paris capitulated after the destruction of Paris by an atomic bomb. The game set place in Paris, where the russian mafia activity is growing since the end of the Paris/USSR war. The game feature many playable characters, mostly in the second game.
In the first game, the player is left with a quick tutorial and no story elements at all, you start the game without even knowing the name or background of the character you are playing. The player soon discover that his character live alone in an appartment in Paris, and that someone leaves cryptic phone's message to him, like a professional call telling him to go at some places to do some work. Our characther follow these instructions and leave his appartment to take his vehicule and drive to the adress of the phone message. However, when the character arrives at the place, the player has to choose an animal mask to wear and discovers a place full of ennemies.The core of the game is to clear all the building by eliminating all the ennemies inside, then going back to your car. Firstly, the player is encourage to kill, with the score and combos system, and the catchy music. However, after succeeding to kill every ennemy, the music stop suddenly, replaced by a weighty sound, and the player has to travel all the way back to his vehicule, seeing all the dead bodies left on the way. The more you progress in the game, the more the story will be brought to the forefront in place of the gameplay, and the player would not only play the game but try to understand what happens.
I liked the game for the unique storytelling, and the meaning that we get after succeeding to understand all the links between the events of the two games.
Despite the first look, Hotline Miami is a game against the violence, and left a strong feeling of accomplishment for both succeed all levels and finally understand the whole story and the message associted.",0

For many years, glasses and contact lenses were the only options if you had myopia. But now you can have a laser surgery and you won't be myopic anymore. You have to be at least eighteen, and your vision must be stable since at least two years. The operation is 15-minutes long for each eye, and only needs a local anaesthesia. With the help of a laser, the surgeon will cut a part of the cornea and then modify the curvature of the eyeball to improve your vision. After the operation, the vision can be a little blurry, that's why it is important to rest and follow the post-operation care closely. After only a few weeks, people who underwent the operation claims that their vision has clearly improved and that they don't need glasses anymore.
 I think that this laser surgery can improve people's lives.
Glasses are fine, but they can be a little bit bothering if it's rainy outside for example, and it is worth saying that some people don't like the aesthetic of glasses. Contact lenses can be a good alternative, but at the end of the day, the eyes can be really dry because of them. Moreover, some people will never be able to wear contact lenses in their life. That's why the laser surgery is important, because it gives people an other opportunity to correct their myopia, and this surgery improves your vision for life. It is not only a correction of an optic problem, it is a long-term solution. In addition to that, the surgery is short and mostly well-tolerated.",1

However my feelings for your festival, I think I would be really helpful and that this experience can make me growing up so fast ! It would also be my pleasure to work for you and it would confort me, or not, in my choice of studies.
I don't need to be paid for this job. I just want to be a part of this organisation, which is so big and famous. For me, it is the best festival of the world, and I am not saying that to be accepted. It mixes work of arts, music and a special event at the same time.
I think I am perfect to help you because, as an student in communication, I know how to use some of the new technologies, how to have the perfect communication and which media is the most interesting to be published on. Knowing my young age, I have a young looking and a young point of view on which communication is better for young people. As far as I am concerned, I think I could be an important element in your teamwork with a fresh looking. For example I think if you want to bring younger people, you can increase your communication and publicity on Tik tok because this social media is very using by teenagers.
Finally, since I know that I would work in festival, my dream has always been to work for the Hellfest. Even if I am not considering myself as a rock and metal fan, I really enjoy the atmosphere of the Hellfest and I think I would become more mature thanks to this experience. I am a huge fan of what you have created and I always will be.
I am looking forward to hear about you,
Best regards

My name is Alex Dupont and I would like to apply for a job at the Hellfest. As
far as I can remember I have always been interesting in this event because
organise one of the most famous festival in the world is complicated, difficult
and a stressful moment but for me it is also and beautiful experience which can
allow me to gain in maturity and to gain experience in the working work.
Furthermore, my dream is to work and to be an important element in the
Hellfest team.
I like to think of myself as an independent and determined young woman,
motivated, helpful and flexible. However, I can also be strict and I am not
scared to say what I think.
I am doing a licence in information and communication so I can help the community
manager or anyone in fact because I am motivated to do what occasion is
presented to me.
I am asking for a scholarship because it would be a great achievement to
work in a festival that I have admired since my childhood. In addition to that,
it would improve my curriculum to have that type of experience in it. I am
thrilled by this experience and I would be so grateful if you allow me to
realise it.
Contrary to the common opinion, the Hellfest is not a simple hard rock
and metal festival. It is also a place where no one is judge and a place of
artistic expression; in the case of work of art as much as in the case of
clothes. I would like to promote the event because it happens only three days
in a year but it is a special event which bring so much people from all around
the world. I know that some people would disapprove me in such world but I am
ready and impatient to show to this people that I can do it and I will do it.
Nevertheless, money is the element which step me away from this dream
and this is why I need that scholarship.
Thank you for your time.
In the waiting of your response.
Best regards.",1

It is the new nike shoes with carbones soles. They are expensive i don't remind how much they were but it was around 250 euros.
So u can imagine that a lot of people can purshase it because it's not that expensive. For example someone who is practicing running since 5 years acquire a good level  and it will be normal if he wants to buy i new pair of running shoes. The average price for quality shoes is around 150 euros. So if you want the ""must have"", you just have to economise 100 euros or asking to your parents or your family for your birthday to help you.
So, it's a new technology wich isn't that far from all it's not only for wealth or rich persons.
Thanks to this invention you can run 4 percent faster than with an usual pair of shoe without costing you more energy. The benefits of them aren't really consequent but when you are at a huge level and in competition they are way to strong and helpfull. In some championship they are forbiden for the athletes because they are considered has cheat.
 There are many consequences about this invention.
First of all, some people think that is cheating
Furthermore, they can help people to be more performant
They are also a bit hard to run with when you haven't experience in running or a few because the sole is really tough. The mouvments of the feet arn't the same as a normal pair of shoe.
Finaly, I think that this invention only has good points because it shows how fast and how far the science can go.",0

Paris is a little city, a old beautiful city, classified at UNESCO. A lot off ERASMUS students went here. That's why I meet a lot of people of different country. I lived in a shared plate with two other Spanish girls.
I could visit too, and go to other city like Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris and Paris...

But other the past few years, scientists discovered the had a very complex way to share informations. In fact, plants can share informations with each other, but by relaesing chemicals in their environment. For example, if one of them is being eaten by some leaf-eating insect, it will send a chemical message in the atmosphere indicating what type of insect is feeding on it so its neighboors can prepare to defend themselves by creating toxic or repulsive molecules for the predator. This communication prooved to be intra and interspecific, meaning even plants from different species can understand the message. This hability is a very interesting advantage for organisms that cannot run away from any danger.
This discovery might gelp scientists to find a biological way to fight against insects which feed on plants used by humans, and to defend native species against invasive arthropods species.
 To my opinion, knowing that plants can communicate and interact with each other could be really usefull for human-beings. By knowing better the ecology of vegetals is interesting , and not only for the scientific discovery, but because of the opportunities it brings to enhance our production capacities in agriculture and to find more ecological ways to protect the environment by using the molecules to prevent the spread of diseases by warning the plants of the incoming danger, for example. And the variety of molecules the plants can create could have other interesting properties that could be usefull in other research fields such as medication. But I think every discovery as to be considered with caution.",0

What’is a NFT ? A NFT is a unique Digital work ( image basical or 2D or 3D but to short video).
Each NFT exists in a single copy. Is a possible to buy a NFT only with a cryptocurrency. The market of NFT this last week is in total evolution. Many of NFT have taken of a lot of value. Each NFT have a speculative price. This price can go up or down.
They are few days ago a man buy a NFT for the price of 11,8 millions dollars.
Many celebrities invest in a Non Fungible Token  as exemple of Alex Dupont wich has invested half a million dollars in the collection of NFT more popular “Bored Ape Yatch Club”.
 For me NFTs il interesting because it touche the world of the cryptoconcurrency but never i will buy NFT even if it has a high valu.

The NFT is ""non-fungible token"", it's not a reel object but he have a value, it's the opposite of a reel money. The NFT can be lot of thing like a image, picture, text, song or vidéo, in short all that can be on internet. Each NFT have a series number that allows to identificate him. When you buy an NFT, you have all the right on him, you can use it to do what you want. A lot of people buy an NFT for reseal after when he take value, whith that, people can have a lot of money.  On today the NFT can have a astronomicale price like 10 000 $ or more and the celebrity start to create there own NFT. The NFT of the celebrity have automaticly a big value because of course that's a celebrity. Some NFT was sale at a millions of dollars. The NFT is already in the video games, in effet, in some vidéo games you can buy and sale a creature who have a value, and because each NFT is unique, you are the only who have this creature. Over the years the NFT can take a big place in internet and,  new concepts can appears in link whith the NFT. In exemple, some french rappers have a virtual appartement in which he exposed his own NfT on the wall of the appartement. To summarize the NFT can be like a investissement in the property but at the place of an appartement you have a non-fungible token.
 For me the NFT is very hard to understand because it's complicated to imagine that a simple image of a monkey can have a very big price. And it's more harder to imagine that a person can win here life whit this NFT. But this can be a good thing in the future because the internet in a parrallel world for me, and i think it's normal to win his life in this world whith new technic. But i also understand the people who think that's ridiculous. The NFT are therefore a good thing to the creator who want to sell his work.",0

They were discovered in 1928 with the penicilium. They are the best solution, even today, against bacteria infection. It was a good discovery because antibiotics cure people from infection which sometimes killed patients.
Today we developted a lot of antibiotics with a large spectrum of activity. But they can have some toxicity on the body like for example kidney toxicity.
 They helped a lot but today we use to much antibiotics in Paris. The problem is that bacterias can develop some adaptation and resistance angainst antibiotics. We used to much antibiotics and unfortunately today they are less efficace than before and bacterias are strongers. In Paris sometimes even if you have a viral infection doctors can give you some antibiotic, but it is not efficace. In Paris for example, they prescribe less antibiotics than in Paris but they are more efficace because bacterias did not develop the same resistance of the treatement as in Paris.
To conclude I think that antibiotics are a wonderfull discovery for the medecine but today in Paris we use it to much and we have to try to reasone and reduce the consommation of antibiotics.",1

My parents convinced me to have my ""baccalauréat"" first, and then go to a pastry school.
During my three year of high school, most of my friend wanted to go on computer science related studies, and little by little, I wanted to know more about this field. In the last year of high school, when we had to choose in which school we wanted to continue our studies, I wanted to try a computer science school. All I knew about was INSA and polytech. But my father told me : ""I often work with ESIR's students, there are very good at their jobs, even if the school is not as known as the INSA"". That is the reason why I put the ESIR in my list. However, I had never written code, so it was a bet. Maybe after the first year, I would have been traumatized by computer science, and wanted to try something else.
Moreover, I still enjoy cooking, but when I have chosen ESIR instead of a pastry school, I told myself : ""I can try to become a pastry chef with a computer science diploma, but not a computer science engineer with a diploma from a pastry school"".
I have kept two ideas as spare wheels, to become either a teacher in high school (probably a math teacher), or a pastry chef. But they are very difficult jobs, so I really hope that I will get my diploma in computer science.
In conclusion, my bet was successful. I really love what I am doing right now, and even if I am sometimes frustrated when we are doing more mathematics than computer science, I think it was the best decision I could make.",0

Even if the most striking invention in the field is the discovery of antibiotics, the bacteria analysis still didn't change since the 70's. However, in the last decade, we could developp new genome-based techniques. In order to simplify the diagnosis and the analysis of bacterial resistance and pathogenesis mechanisms, researchers and pharmaceutical companies from all over the world have spent their time, money and a lot of dedication to these new techniques. Following an example (ISG15 & Chlamydia trachomatis), this short article will present you the guidelines to follow in order to create a technique of this kind.
At first, you must ensure that the pathology that you want to study is related to a single and specific pathogen (bacteria, ...). Then, an harassing work of molecular mechanisms elucidation needs to be done in order to understand : how, when and why the pathology appears, as well as how can we detect it and how can we treat/cure it. If we already have medicines which may target this microbe, then we may have to use it. Else we have to create a new molecule to fight against the pathogen using the different molecular mechanisms we previously discovered.
The example I took is an human, innate imunnity-related protein called ISG15 during genital infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis. This protein was thought to have little impact on this bacteria but it has been recently established that it could be an indicator of vaginal chlamydiosis. Actually, this intracellular protein is found in the infected cells at an early stage of infection and in the blood at a later stage. The plasmatic levels of ISG15 could help the diagnosis. The upregulation of this protein may be related to a better recovery of the infection in mice -even if it can't be the only way to cure it.
 In conclusion, my personal opinion on the discovery of the importance of ISG15 in Chlamydia-related infections stands in 2 points. Once again, it shows that we can still developp and create anti-infective agents. It is also a quite beautiful proof that modern bacteriology needs to go further and further in the detail when trying to discover a new drug.",0

Mereover, if I do this travel, this is allow me to discover new coutums, culture and way of life and it's can be really benefict on the job of journalist because he is expose to peoples, situations which can be orignals and inabitual.

This is why I write you today,  indeed, to realize this project I need a scholarship who can be allow me to take the plane and more generally, to live and study in Paris.  Go in Paris it's a project very important for me and my study and I hope you accept to help me. I always be a serious and motivate student, if your response it positive, will be continue.

It also aims to get more patients to take the vaccine as the number of person taking it has decreased this last two years, espescially after all the polemics around vaccines' safety.
This new plan has been welcomed by many patients who think it's easier to go to their local pharmacy to get a shot then to their GP. However doctors and nurses response was not as good. In fact they feel like pharmacists are stealing their job.
So far this experiment has been a real success. The health Minister is planning to expand it to all the parmacies across Paris if they agree to do it. This will require pharmacies to have a small room where patients can take their shot but also pharmacy students to get trained on how to vaccinate.
 I think it was a very good idea from the government to allow pharmacists to vaccinate. In fact, we see patients more than doctors do. Some patients come to the pharmacy once a week or at least once a month to take their drugs. It's easier to go see your pharmacist as you don't need an appointment. Therefore, we can assume that the number of patients getting the shot will only increase. It is also easier and faster for the patients because they buy the vaccine from the pharmacy anyway, so getting the shot at the pharmacy is less of a hassle for them.",1

And i'm not saying this because I am twenty years old now, because his pupils seems to absorb the knowledge he try to teach them. What i forgot to say is that when i did my training course, the teacher was not teaching first grade anymore but in fourth grade, wich is quite different from first grade of course. So i asked to see for a day the current firts grade's teacher. And it was quite different of my experience when i was a student in this grade. But I loved it, it was much more groups works and rituals.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the teacher I had in first grade will always be my inspiration, even if as a feacher I would like to use a method much more collective.",0

At the time, I just  had discovered youtube and the video game called ""Minecraft"". A lot of content creators had a introduction at the beginning of the video to identify themselve and something just clicked in my head, I wanted to do that.
In 2010 or so, technical tutorials were not as common as today, and there were few really qualified people to teach about complex software as 3d softwares. But with some work and exploration of all the content that I could find at the time, I downloaded a software called ""Cinema 4d"" which is still an industry standard today, and starded doing my on youtube introduction on the family computer.
My 3d render were bad at the time because of my limited knowledge, I'll also admit that about 75% of my creations were only me following tutorials but I was proud of myself and for a ten years old boy it was ok. Moreover, even with great knowledge, the raw performances of a family computer was not enough to do high quality stuff, but the creative process around it hooked me into computer graphics.
After that period, I went in my teenager era if I can say so, I had far less learning and creation done but I was the ""graphic designer"" of my friend.
The next part in my journey toward computer graphics is far more recent, just before going to college, we need to ask us about what we will be doing in the futur and the idea of computer graphic resurfaced like something obvious in my head. Since then I work every month or so on computer graphics software, for personnal project or for student association lately.
Nowadays it is far easier to learn about 3d software, there are more an more profesionnal courses that you can access online for free and the community is always here to help if you have any trouble. One of thing that helped is that a lot is a software called blender, it is free and opensource, so everyone can do his own thing done with it. Since it is very popular it is almost be concidered as a standard in the field, it is not really used in the industry because it is a general software and the industry tends to used specialized software to do really specific tasks but it can do a lot of thing greatly ! For example one of the episode of the serie ""love, death, robot"" on netflix was made using only blender.
However, my professionnal project evolved through the years, I joined ESIR because of the digital imaging specialization with the idea work in the field but with no clear idea of what I'll do later. As of today, I'm realy interested in special effects from the movie and it is my aiming point but I am more and more interested in AI generated art which is kiind of the revolution.",1

This community appeared on 1864 and was created by Alex Dupont. This man had the idea of creating this type of association thanks to a war. In fact, he was on the battleground and saw a man in distress so he decided to help him. He wanted on a church and started to give some first aids. He was joined by some women and nurses.
Nowadays the Red Cross Association count a lot of volunteers, and, thanks to their humanity, they help a lot of people by feeding, caring or accommodate them. Whereas it was first an association to heal the soldier, with the time it grew up and has spread to multiple missions as we saw just before.
Moreover, a lot of different people can work and participate on the Red Cross. Indeed, with the enlargement of the association, you can do a nurse, a social worker, a doctor, a nursery etc.
To sum up, the Red cross is a really great association.
 I think the Red Cross association is a great idea and innovation. In fact it help some people when they are in need. You can be a volunteers when you want and see what's beeing in the need is.",1

With the headphone, gamers doesn't see the real world and listen what happend around he, he only sees the games word and listens what happend in the games. This technology works with captors witch permits gamers to evolve in the games. For example, he can walk, jump ...
The goal of this technology is creating artificial words generated and  managed by softwares to immersed people in a different word.
This technology is also used by companies to sell their products or services. For example, an attraction parc can use the VR to show a part of an attraction. If the customer find this experience good, he can buy their place for this attraction parc.
This technology is used in the domain of the education. VR  permits to recreate things that be explained by the teacher and students can see that in the same time. So this technology permits to have a better comprehension method and do things that they can't do in the reality, for example, in chemistry, dangerous experience with products that the etablissement doesn't got.
 One of the consequences of this technology, in the domain of video games, is gamers have the impression to be in the game. This consequence has good side, like the gamers has a better experience but also bad side, this consequence can increase the addiction of the video games.
This technology can have bad consequences in the health if VR is used during a long time in cause of waves produced by the headphone.

At first sight i though it was bad because most of my classmates parents were not really carring about their children marks. So since this moment, i always felt like my parents were carring too much and it oppressed me. After the secondary school, i grew up, so things appeared to me differently but it took time for me to realise the fact that i was lucky to have my parents carring a lot about my studies. I can remember now this one sentence my mother were always telling me: ""you study for you, not for us"". The first time i heard it, i was completely not agreeing with it because i was studying for them, i did not wanted to be a shame for them. As i said i realize by growing up how i was false. So i went to the scientific section in highschool because i had great marks in chemistry and mathematics. I realized that my parents allows me to chose what i really wanted to study.
I went to ESIR right after the Baccalauréat because i did not wanted to do infomartic, the ""prépa"" in ESIR is specialised in chemistry and physics, this course is great because it is containing many informatic classes and it is no far way from my parents house. In my everyday life, clothes and shoes are one of my passions. So i though that i could combine sciences and clothes in my studies.

The first antibiotics was discovered by a scientific Alex Dupont during a fungi test by chance.
They are a lot of antibiotics family, for example, b-lactamin, aminoside, tetracycline, macrolide...
Most of them have some toxicity. We can have fever, make a anaphylactic choc and dead, if we are allergic to penicillin. You don't have to used tetracycline if you have under 8 years old because you growing up and tetracycline can impact your bones (not important) but can also impact your teeth and make it yellow. It's not very beautiful..  Aminoside is not recommended if you have some kidney problems. So, we can have very tragic toxicity (death), it is why antibiotics must be used with attention and prescribed by a specialist.
Today, a lot of people use automedication and they don't know the risk of that. As we said, there is  a risk of toxicity but not only.
There is many antibiotic's resistance because of automedication and bad compliance. People takes antibiotics for something which don't deserve it like a flue, stop their treatment before the end. All of this mistakes increase the resistance, it's very dangerous.
 I think it's important to know that antibiotics are not a medication without risk and know that we are taking risk when we take it without prescription. In the next twenty years, if we don't found solution, people can died because of little infection caused by a bacteria, because of this resistance, because antibiotics will not be effective.",0

This choice that I made was of course and like anyone, I guess, motivated by some experiences I lived in the past. So now, I am going to talk about my inspirations which made me being a biomedical student.
First of all, I always have been pretty good at studying science, whether it was the maths, physical, chemical... But the biological is and has always been my favourite one. Indeed, I really think this science is pretty much endless and anyone with a strong willness and a scientist spirit can brings his own contribution to the searchings. That is due to the fact that some subjects are really sharp and can only be about one specific cell of one specific creature. Moreover, there is zero theory which is an absolute truth. Anything can be second thinking if someone finds a new stuff about it, which is contrary with the previous believing. Furthermore, to add a more personal argument, I find this science so interesting, just because you learn how the world and the animals around you exist and live. You even learn about your own existence and how you are able to do what the human beings are able to.
As you have just seen, I am interested in biology, but this is not the only thing that inspired me doing biomedical studies. Actually, when I was younger, i did an internship into a vet cabinet. During that period, I saw some surgeries on animals and it did not scare me at all but rather inspired me about the importance of the healthcare system, even though it was on animals and not on humans. I found the surgeries very interesting because it also enabled me to see the actual inside of the body and to understand the different organes' roles.
With that being said, you can know understand why I turned towards the biological sector after my bachelor degree. And, to be fair, learning about biology made me even asking more questions about it. In this science, the more you know and the more you realize you don't at the same time, because there are always some mecanism that you don't learn about how it works but just about what it does. It makes me think about astrology in that way.
To conclude, I have always been interested in science in general, but biology is the one I find the most interesting and I especially like the fact it seems endless. However, the event which made me a biomedical student is actually my first internship.",1

The 21st century had just began and many ways of communication had seen the light throught the years. One of the most important for me wad the creation of the laptop. Appeared in 1981, the first laptop was an incredible revolution for those who needs to work in unusual places like planes or trains. Its size greatly reduced allowed people to transport it wherever they wanted, and its weight of just 12 Kilos made its use very practical. However, the use of these laptops was strictelly professional. Nowadays, laptops have evolved and offer even more possibilities. First, the use of these tools had become more recreational over the years, and it's now possible to watch movie, play video games or even listen to music with a laptop thanks to the internet. Of course, it still almost essential to possess a laptop for work, but they not reduce to this utility. Then, laptops have change the world of communication, with the apparition of social media and others platform. Meeting people virtually is now possible and available for everyone, for exemple, many people now have friends they haven't meet in real life who lives miles from them. But, the more impressive evolution is that now, we can access to almost every knowledges on earth. Discovering something is now so easy, and open the doors of a new world of consciousness.
 I find that in the first place this evolution cannot be wrong for the humankind. Everything is easelly available, even a child can make a search on the internet. Working on a laptop is also pleasant and can be done everywhere. But I think these developements can be really dangerous on the long term. Knowledge is now so easy to access that many of us have stop thinking by themselves. If they want to answer the easiest question, internet and the laptop know the answer, if they need life advice, the same thing happen. So many people now can't live without a laptop, without being connected to the world and the others. Children are no longer children and many spend their day in front of a screen, watching mediocre content. But there isn't only bad things about these laptop. It allowed everyone to know and communicate freely, to discover and learn.",0

Now we all use electrical ones, and this improvement totally changed the technology field. We just need to compare the computer seld in the early twenty-one century and now, the biggest difference are the weight and the volume, this is due to the size of the battery inside. Behind this there are many scientist who work on improving the efficiency and the lithium ions are the most practical solution that they find for the moment, it is use in our phone for exemple. However the battery still have a long way to go because of the effects that it might have on the environment. The last reaserches are base on the dioxygène because it does not polute however it is quit dangerous because it can explose. But we keep finding ways to secure it.

This event  has played a key role in my orientation, giving me the will to work with computers, in order to create amazing objects and giving the possibility to reach new horizons. In other words : it made me dream.
 While reading theses lines,  I think you've guessed : I was in an IT company.
 The internship lasted three days only,  but they were sufficient to convince me !
 We were 3 school boys from different places, and  we had a full schedule, with no time to rest. In deed, each 2 hours, we had a meeting with a specialist that was working in the company, in a specific field. Almost all of them were engineers or researchers in computer science, but each of them was working in a whole new  domain. This diversity of subjects made me realize that with studies in computer science, I would never get bored, as there are things to discover and handle every day (IT is changing really fast, with the apparition of new technologies and concepts all the time).
 Since that moment, my vision has obviously changed and sharpened, but the spark that it created in my mind never blew off, quite the contrary.
 Still, at the end of  High School, when I had to decide where I was going the years after (what studies I would do), I had little apprehension about the fact that I would like to work in computer science.
 Despite everything, I had only OBSERVED and not practiced, so there was a chance that I would appreciate new technologies from a user perspective, but not as a developer.
 Hopefully, some month after I was starting my IT license, and the courses were amazing and very interesting : I had made the good decision.",1

And because cancer is mainly a desease of old people it became one of the first cause of death in the developped world. In the battle against cancer the nanoparticles are one of the most hopefull lead. Those particles are able to reach the tumor and deliver the medication right inside it. The main advantage is thair ability to be very specific and therofore to damage only the tumor, while leaving almost untouched the suroundings tissues. Even more, they deliver the medication only when around the tumor, which largely reduce the amount of medication in the general circulation and the amount of sides effect. Howewer great in theory those nanoparticles appears to be less efficient then expected in practice. Furthemore the hypothtical sides effects du to the particles themselves are still unexplored and need to be taken in consideration.
 This lead in research is exiting and promising, but as often in medical and biological research it is dispointing to see that the effective results are far from what was expected... Frome greats ideas, years and sometimes decades are needed to develop an actual effective treatment, which is almost never as promising as it apperead to be in the first place. As for those nanoparticles use to cure cancer, years of research will be necessary before allowing a test on actual patients with no garantee of success. Research is all about patience and be prepared to be dispointed because great break through and discovery are rare and always based on lots of smaller discoveries and disapointment.",0

In fact, they refuse the monopoly that the companies and administration have on the technologies and they start protestations. The members of the Californian counter-culture will, therefore, find a way to connect on Arpanet where they will develop discussion forums to share tips on music or to debate politic, for example. However, that started to be a problem for American administration because more and more people were connected to Arpanet. They finally decided to cut Arpanet in two parts : Milnet for the military and Arpanet for the others.
 In my opinion, the Californian counter-culture is at the origin of a turning-point for our world. They completely change the society.

 Even though research is uncertain concerning most of the points we are gonna evoke further down, results are still revolutionning the way we see nutrition and the importance of micobiota in its contenant, which is the intestine.
 Microbiota is about all microorganisms which are interacting within the intestine : mushrooms, bacterias, viruses and such. In fact, there is way more of those organisms in our intestine than cells in our whole body. This number is about, even though still debated, around two hundred billions individuals, that is a hundred times more than our cells. Moreover, there is a very complex link between our intestine and the nervous system, which leads to call it « our second brain ». Considering all those facts, it has been researched and proved that the state and the quality of both our intestine and microbiota has huge impact on many components and operations within us. Therefore, we are gonna focus on the impact of what we eat over these.
 In order to keep our intestine and its inhabitants safe, it has been recently proved that we need to avoid some nutrients and favor some others.
First of all, we should avoid excessive consumption of sugar, especially added ones. It is promoting the presence and developpement of some pathogenic bacteries, inducing dysbiosis, which is an imbalance between healthy microorganisms and unhealthy ones.  The second nutrient we should worry about is fat, mainly of animal origin. Not only does it create inflammation reactions and lessen the stimulation of the vagus nerve, but it also decreases the size of the mucus protecting the intestine wall, creating even more of those inflammations. Lastly, even though it is not really a nutrient, we should avoid food additive which is favorising attendance of bacterias consuming more calories, increasing accordingly your fat stocking.
 Contrariwise, we should increase our portion of some healty elements, divided in two categories : prebiotic and probiotic. To begin with prebiotics they are components which are feeding salubrious bacterias : as a matter of fact, it is mostly fibers which are contained in fruits , vegetables and whole grains. Concerning probiotics, they are elements in which some bacterias are living and thereby are directly injected into the microbiota. Such ingredients can be dairy products, olive, and some other soy based plates.
 All those hopeful results could open the door to a new type of preventive medecine, based on improving daily life nutrition, in order to avoid taking all those pills we have been capitalizing on until now.",1

to many journey as possible. And in the study I choose to take, the
international dimension is a huge part, discovering other people and
other culture are a big part for inderstanding people, and to do
communication. That why i’m writing to you today, I let myself
think that I deserve a year in a foreign country.
Their
is a lot of adventage of discovering a country during one year. For
exemple : having a year in a foreign country is the occasion for
me to have a perfect english, and never doubting of what i'm saying
again. This exeperience will surely change myself forever. I think
that in my position as a student this journey is essential, I will be
back much better and with more skills to be a better student in
communication.
That
why to complete this projet, I will need your help, in fact this
projet cost a lot of money and I need you to give me a scolarship in
order to make this Alex Dupont who is also my dream possible.
My
plan are to go to Paris to studying communication but also to meet
other people that surely do not think or see the word as i’m seeing
it.

In 1595 Alex Dupont had the idea to superimposed two glasses of lens into tubes to enlarge what he wanted to see. In 1675 Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont modify the system to see things that are invisible for humans and so they were the first to observe a human cell. Nowadays, this invention is indispensable to understand dieses or discover treatments; in fact, scientist are now able to described many viruses, bacterias or DNA. Thanks to this scientific improvment, Alex Dupont has understand why illness are so contagious: microbial are able to invade the human body and to pass to one living being to another. Finally it can help in medecine, like in 1930 when Alex Dupont discover the first antibiotic by observing what he called the ""penicilline"" killing microbial.
 	In my opinion, this technology is unavoidable to understand the world. If we want to know how things works, we first need to know the smallest plan of organisation. Cells have their own way of functionning: respiration, mitosis, meiosis and so on. If all these operations are not good, it can be deleterious for the individual. For exemple a missreplication of the DNA can induce sterility or death. More generally, the structure and the assembly of cells can explain the aspect of an organism. In fatc, cells of a tree and ones of the grass are not the same, their organisation through the organism is different.
	Furthermore, microscopes are essential in microbiology and so in medecine. Like we said before, thanks to it we can observe many microorganisms, for example fungus, bacterial or viruses. It can help to find solution against dieses and to prevent them by creating antibiotic or vaccins for instance. It can also help to understand the way of evolution of cancers.",1

I worked, during an intership, on the micropropagation of onion in a varietal creation context. We had to establish a culture medium where seeds or any kind of onion’s tissues could grow and differenciate into a new clone plant identical to the initial plant we used. First few weeks were reading papers and finding informations about the experience, how scientists already did it, even on another vegetable and how much time and money it costed. Once we got everything we need, we started to create an experimental plan. We created 6 culture medium with different concentration of hormones, macroelements, microelements and vitamins. Then, we took some Onion’s inflorescence and put it on the medium we made just after disinfected it. After 2 weeks of development, we were able to see cell clusters called ""cal"". We transplanted the explants onto fresh culture media, and waited one month in the hope of obtaining a differentiation of the previously obtained cells into tissues. After a few weeks, we could see buds. This was a sign that the experiment was working, and that we would obtain plants from the culture of the differentiated onion inflorescence tissue. To be honest, it was the first time i worked on a lab, and it was a really great experience to see plants growing thanks to the culture medium we made for it.
The consequences of this discovery were the use of the culture medium with the most favourable cloning yields in a daily protocol still used in the laboratory today. It is still a great moment to give your help and time to a company to develop what could lead to new variety discoveries. This project had not been shelved since other trainees were also able to contribute to this study after me, with the aim of always improving the yields obtained from the culture of clones.

It works as a selection of a group of neurones which can be activated or not by choice.
The mecanism is a little bit complicated, the scientist put a particular mechanism on the animal that can drive some laser pulse in a precise part of the brain. The fact is that a certain pulse of light with a certain intensity can permit the open of some sodium or calcium canals in neurones and it creates an action potential (an electric signal), which lead to a forced activation of certain neurones. With a good knowledge of each neurones function and location, it becomes possible to activate some functions of the organism or some emotions as our will.
For example, it has been tested on rats and it is possible to activate a behaviour of agressivity or not by sending a pulse on the right neurones.
 In my opinion, this discovery can open the door to more and more experiences on the neuronal system. Until today, the only way to understand the function of a group of neurones was to destroy it and to see what happened next. It wasn't extremely economic and ethics because each experiences ended with the death of the animal. With optogenetic, we can just activate or not a group of neurones and observe the consequences without destroy it. This recent discovery will probably be very important for the future of science, in particular in neurobiology.",1

But as I was suffering, she was telling me about this new research project she was working on with some dentists colleagues, but also doctors, biologists, research scientists and engineers.
The idea of this project is to developp a new technology which would be really helpfull in reparing tissue damage.  This new technology is based on a collaboration between 3D printers developpers and, biologists. Indeed, they are developping 3D printers, that might be able to print a human organ, from a simple blood sample. As of now, they are working more precisely on how to print new human tooth, and how to make it viable in the patient's mouth after implantation. They are starting with tooth because they are quite easily implantable, or removed in case of complications during or after the surgery. But even if printed humain tooth would be a great progress for dentist and their patients, the main goal of this project is to be able to print for example a liver, or a heart for a patient who needs a transplant.
This would substancially decrease the waiting time for patient on the transplant waiting list, because if the project goes as far as it is suppose to, you could be admitted in the ER at 5AM, after a car crash, and from one simple blood sample of yours, 3 hours later, a new heatlhy heart would be created by the 3D printer and ready to replace your own injured heart.
These new printers might also come very handy for those who suffered massive burns, like firefighters, because now, thanks to this engineering/biologists collaraboration, with only few drops of blood in the printer, biologists could print in a matter of hours as much skin tissues as they would need to repair the burned skin.
The main advantage of this new way of creating human organs is the viability of these tissues. Indeed, there would no longer be any matter about donor/receiver compatibility, because the organ would directly come from the receiver, which mean it would be his blood, his genes that would be used to create this new skin, and therefor, no further need to worry about failed transplants.
Moreover, organ receivers wouldn't need to wait anymore for other people to die, for them to have organ, they could be treated right away, in better conditions, and in a much more safer and durable way.
This new sciences breakthrought might literaly change the face and pratice of modern medicine, and that is amazing!
However, no matter how amazing this new project his, they are still working on it, trying to bring it to life, but as of now, they are only able to print human tooth (wich is already quite fascinating), but my entist assured me that in a decade or two, self-printed new skin tissue for burns would be a daily operation.",1

First of all, my name is Alex Dupont,  i'm a french student in SI, i practice VolleyBall and i love the tesla cars. I love to see how technology helps us in the everyday life. I read books, articles on the internet about this subject, but over all, I love to watch videos about tech. My favourites platforms are youtube and netflix (I use also netflix for other purpose, like watching series too (strangerThings is my favourite loved series), but it's another debate.).
So, I usaly watch vulgarisation videos about complicated subjects, ( I recomend you mark Alex Dupont on youtube if you like this kind content).
Las week I saw a video of a man, who drive his tesla car. Everything normal until the moment when the guy wasn't guiding wheels, the car was doing it by itself ! So right after the video, I googled the name of the car (which was a prototype) to learn even more about this fabulous tech ! It's a realy big step in self driving cars. Talking about software is the thing when you see a system like that !
The car is full of sensor like lidar sensors to get the environement topology, cameras to be more precise, microphones to get the ambiant sound. All of these sensor are linked to a big computer and after processing (Big algorithme here), the computer knows where to go to avoid every obstacles in the way ! The car even monitor the outside world and the path it choose to take. This is a state of the age technology.
All the obstacles can be like pedestrians, other cars, cat, dogs, grandMa, shopping cart, truck, your sister, a mom and even a mouse ! A mouse ? yes a mouse ! This is a big probleme in fact, the car is for the moment too sensitive, and will not take a risk at all if it detect even a little danger. In this case, the car will break and ask the driver to take the control. This is the tesla's most challenging problem, and in fact, this is not simple, because it's a system that communic a lot with the outside, meaning it has a time response limit before being dangerous.
For example, a breaking descision has to me made in time, like breaking to avoid a collision with a pedestrian.
We arrive at one of the most debatable subject about self driving cars : ""if a car has to make the descision between go on a tree to avoid a pedestrian or crush the pedestrian (if there is only these two choices) what the car should do ?"". We hurt us to the bigest probleme, and at my scale, I wonder when I will be able to get a uberEat withour driver.

She is the most caring person I have met in my life. Her and I are quite close : she is my secret-keeper person, my best friend and my mother.
I am a very anxious person. I tend to be really hard on myself and be really stressed for my studies. I am the kind of person who is always afraid of being left out and I need to be reassure everyday that what I am is fine.
My mother is the exact opposite : she does not care about what people think of her. She follows her own way of life. She doesn't have many people to talk to and she is ok with it even thought she tends to be quickly disappointed by people she let partly get in her life. She had a really hard childhood : her parents weren't there the most part of her life and she is still dealing with it.
She is the only member of her family that has the French high-school diploma and was criticized by her sister most of the time for it. She went to the university to study languages and literature but she failed her first year and her father didn't want to paid more for it, so she had to quit. (He has a lot of money, so that's not why he didn't want her to continue) She made a 2-years study in publicity and really enjoyed it : She is really great with communication, drawings and words. When she finished, she was in the three people out of twenty in her class who succeeded and had the diploma. She began her ""adult life"" by working for the family oyster-famers company, and she is still in right now. She is now co-director with her brother and she take care of the international market : she speaks English very well and she also learned Italian.
My mother has always taught me to believe in myself and to be the best version of myself in everything, but especially for school. She wants me and my brother to do something in our life that we enjoy, a life we will be happy about.
When I was younger, I always told her that I wanted to be a doctor, until my last year of high school. I was immature and everything was overwhelming for me. I felt like if I do medicine at university, I will failed and be furthermore hard on myself. She was really confused of my change of path, espacially because I had no back-up plan for my life.
She immediately (and secretly) made researches based on my favorite subjects at school, subjects I was the best at, and came to me a week later with tons of possibilities. I was glad she cared so much. We started making researches together and thanks to her, I went into a preparatory school, and then I get into ESIR.
I cannot express the love I have for her, even thought I try to every time I go home. She always tried her best for me and she is now doing that with my brother. She wants to be there for us, not just be like her parents towards us, and it's a real blessing. She is an incredible woman, she is the reason why I am here, and moreover, she inspired me everyday of my life, on everything.",1

So why am I now in the information and communication licence ?
First of all, I had the idea of become journalist since I choose the speciality HGGSP in highschool. I was also thinking of working in the communication because to me it was a field open to the world, wich is related with my desire of travelling, meeting a lot of people. Then I think that my personality fits with it. I am not afraid to talk in front of people, I am curious and love to work in group with other students.

Over the time, technology as we know it has taken a major part in our everyday life. As it gets more and more included into our lives, it became difficult to even consider having to exist without it. Indeed, technologies are everywhere. Whether it is professionally, politically or socially speaking. It evolved our society, merging new possibilities and interests. They have turned upside down the world as we used to know it. That being said, this new era offers a number of advantages and life-changing improvements. First of all, the biggest positive aspect we can point out is how it links the entire world. International long-term relationships are now an easy process thanks to social medias, for example. We are connected all around the globe, making the diffusion of informations easier than ever. It is particularly advantageous when it comes to research development. Nowadays, access to knowledge has democratized by the expansion of the internet. To conclude for the first part, technology has made possible the impossible by improving multiples areas of expertise such as: science, divertissement and social studies and many others.
Except that is also important to consider the negative outcomes we can get from it. Social medias and technology itself is great, but as many things, it needs to be controlled really particularly. If not, there may cause some negative impacts in the human's minds. When they are used without being cautious, they can really affect someone's life. Social medias for instance, can increase the risk of depression and anxiety amongst the users. So these platforms need to be used carefully, with limitations while being aware of its risks. It is important to put aside the unreal version of facts we can see on the internet such as fake news. Using it can be highly addictive and can have an effect on the mental health of everyone. Therefore, learning the good methods of using those is paving the way of having an healthy-digital use.

Originally called Musically, TikTok is an app on mobile devices that has known worldwide success in the past 3 years. This app can be used to post, edit and view content in a video format. It contains an algorithm that allows the users to watch videos suggested to them at all time and scroll continuously, constantly provided with new content. We can safely say that this social media has been a very important trend-setter, especially among the younger generation, as its number of users increased up to a billion over the last few years.
 In my opinion, like every big social media platform, it has negative and positive consequences. To me, TikTok has contributed to the expansion of the ""influencer culture"" originally initiated by its elder, Instagram. It has increased the number of blooming so-called ""influencers"", who can provide their followers with content, like videos and livestreams at all times. Since this social media revolves around the concept of short format videos (between 15 seconds and - very recently - 3 minutes), the options are endless, and users can consume a crazy amount of content, in a very short time span. Sometimes content-creators are likely to see their videos get thousands, sometimes millions of views over a few hours, which increases even more the production of content over time. It has become a never-ending cycle. To my mind, TikTok is the perfect example of this new era of digital consumerism.",1

A year ago, I was lost in my orientation and I did'nt know where to go to study after having my ""baccalauréat"". I had maths and LLCER english as specialities last year in high school just because I had rather good grades, not for my future orientation. So I saw a lot of people during my three year of high school to help me find my way. At first, people wanted me to go in music or art school because these are my passions. But I wasn't really sure about it and I wanted to keep my passions as passions and not as studies. A month before the ""Parcoursup"" inscription, I saw a woman, Alex Dupont, who wanted to help me find my way not by knowing my passions but by knowing my personality. She surprised me because she wasn't like the others and really helped me. As I was talking with her (she talked a lot but it's okay because I'm shy), so she talked and discovered by my parents studies and how and where I grew up that three ways were for me: psychology, art and sociology. She said that psychology would be a good way for me but because I'm hypersensitive it could be hard. At this time, I was drawing a lot just for fun and by the way I liked to add hidden messages in my drawings. One time, I showed her some of my drawings and she asked me if I knew the Communication Licence. I didn't know what it was so I did a lot of researches and I told myself ""Why not?"". So, after this, I went to a lot of presentations of info com and near to where I live, it was all private school which cost a lot of money and my family couldn't afford that. I went visiting Paris but this licence wasn't here anymore since a long time. So, when I searched in Paris for a communication licence in university, I found Rennes 2 University. My house is 150km far from here so I wasn't really sure about going to this city. When Marine called me an evening, I told her about this and she helped me thinking better about ""starting a new life"". Unfortunately, I wasn't in good relations with my friends in high school so, going far from them, because a lot of people in my school were going in Paris or Paris, could be a great idea. It was hard to choose but when the ""Parcoursup"" resultats were out, I partically immediately chose the only licence I wanted in Paris: I was going to study in information and communication.",1

To reduce the risk of an electricity penury especially during winter where the temperature are very low, the development of the renewables energies can be the solution. The implantation of the solar panels seams to be the best way to convinced people.
First of all, the solar panels are producing electricity from the sun which isn't going to disappear in the next years like the petrol. They can be put almost everywhere and there are a lot of different size from the little one to recharge an object to the giant one in ""solar panels farm"" to aliment fabrics or houses. The fact to have solar panels over a house is good for the environment but also for reducing the price of the electricity. Indeed, the electricity produce on the roof is use for the house but when it's not use the electricity company can buy it for other houses and of course it means that you are less dependent of the electricity production from the company. Furthermore, the lithium can be recycle.
The solar panels aren't only good things. They are made of lithium that isn't a renewable source and that is very expansive. Moreover, even if the lithium can be recycling like I say before, it is complicated to recycle, in fact it's expansive so a lot of companies don't do it and just throw it up. After that we can ask us if the impact that it's suppose to be good for the planet isn't worst. The price for the solar panels and it installation is expansive and to make them functional they need sun, so when you live in cloudy area, it doesn't seam to be the right solution.
To conclude, I can say that the solar panels aren't by their own the solution to stop the climate changes but are a part of it.",0

X-Rays were accidentally discovered when a German physicist Alex Dupont was studying the process of electric current passing through a gas of extremely low pressure. He observed that in a darkened room, the cathode ray tube covered with barium platinocyanide caused a fluorescent effect. Since the cathode rays are invisible, he didn’t know what the rays were and named it X-radiation for its unknown nature. He won the first-ever Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery. The initial reception to the discovery, however, was met with hostility and mockery with a New York Times journalist referring to it as ""an alleged discovery of a method to photograph the invisible"".
 On my point of view, X-ray imaging are an amazing invention but when it was invented, the scientists did not know the adverse effects of the X-Ray.
But there is a lot of adverse effects of this type of medecine because of there ray are nuclear radiation. So, as they did not know this, they made a lot of X-ray exams and a lot of patient developped a cancer and chronical diseases.

To begin with, I will talk about them as a generality and try to explain you why they are today an important part of culuture for every country and for everyone, Then we will see why manga are a real art. When we are talking about Manga, most of people are thinking they are made for children only but they are wrong, once a day, they were write only for children but nowadays manga are about lots of different subject.
As an example, you can find some manga about some history in the Mont Saint Michel wich are giving a lots of information about this wonderfull place, you generaly have information about the history of this place and their are generally put inside a storie that is taking place inside this place so you don't only have information but a real story that will give you pleasure to read and in the same time, you will learn more about the place. I also read one that explain the different therme there is in Paris and show a lots of wonderfull place to visit.
Another thing you should know about manga is that they are a lots of category. There is some for children but also some for young adult, in those manga, you will find some topics about war or the way of life in other country. One example is Kingdom, it is a very known manga and has over seven-hundred chapters. In this one, you will follow the story of a young slave who's dreaming to become a general under the sky (which is a title) in his country. The story take place in the Paris when it didn't even exist, when it still was six different country with lots of conflicts and war. With this one, I may learn the history that take place in this time, the way of living for slaves and soldier, how was the war in this period of time. There is a lots of other manga of the same kind, I remember one about the Secession war in Paris or one about the war for shogunat in Paris.
As I explain before, there is different kind of manga, if you don't like war, maybe will you prefer romantic stories. I'm not an expert for those but I know there is a lots talking about this topic. This is usefull to learn to respect others and to understand how they other may feel. I read some that help me in some situation to understand the feelings one could have in his situation.
Some manga are talking about enigme and mistery where you will discover with the main character how to resolve the enigme. Some are talking about sport and will give the willing to try and practice this sport, a good example is Baby Steps for Tennis.
Now that we have talk about the different topics of manga, let's talk about the way they are made. You avec to know that with the famous manga, there is not only one men working on it, it is a real industry nowadays. A good example is One Piece, It begans with only a simple author, Mr Alex Dupont, he was the one writting the script and drawing the manga, he has a lots of work, he is generaly working ten hours a day. But with the succes of his manga, many things about it began to raise. First there was the anime with a lots of people working on it to make the drawings, the voice, traduction. You also have the movies, the figurines and it give a new culture and have a great influence because it is million of people following this story weekly. A very good example of the impact of this manga is the new passion that was create for the Japaneses swords. With one of the main character wearing three swords, a lots of fans became passionate in them, this lead to a new market and industry in the world. Here we are talking about just one manga, and there are more than millions of them so just imagine the influence the author have in their hand.
But writting manga is not an easy task, first you will have to find a good story and good characters to have the interest of readers, but you will also have to learn how to draw. And about the drawing, there are a lots of ways for them, it's a real art because it is the same as painting, there is many way to paint and different kind and it is the same for manga. A good example are the drawing of eyes, first you will have to chose a basic form and then you will have to pass the different emotion of your character trough them then you will have to learn the mecanics of corpse and physics basics and you will have to learn to draw the envirronement aroud the character wich is another kind of work like drawing buildings or park. The are lots of theories to learn about this art.
So here I try to explain to you why manga are made for everyone and every coutry and the different culture trough differents thematics and kind of stories. Moreover it is also a complete art trough the hard working you have to put inside to make just one page and the differents theory there is about the drawing and writting process.",0

It took almost 30 years and involved a lot of people. First, the research began with Mr. Alex Dupont, a doctor who found on a bacteria that DNA was the component of chromosomes. He didn't know the structure of our genetical material but it was a really helpful start that was continued by a biochemist, Mr. Alex Dupont who found out the nucleotides that are contained in DNA. Those nitrogen based nucleotides are adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. Alex Dupont thought that they were linked like a pearl necklace, he didn't know it's structure. Then a woman, Alex Dupont with other scientists like Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont, through X-rays found that DNA was actually a double DNA strand.
 I think it really help us because nowadays we can help analysing and understanding diseases. Thus, we can save people from dying or at least being sick in a way that weren't able to before.",1

I had to do 1 full week in a community pharmacy during my 3rd year. I also had to make a report about the dyslipidemias and how to treat them in a community pharmacy.
I did this intership in a little community pharmacy in the city center of Paris with just one pharmacist. It was interresting but a bit long and i had some exams to work on for the week after so i talked to my pharmacist about it and she said that if i finished my report before friday i could go home earlier.
So i spent the majority of my time working on that report and I didn't even go and speak with some patients because I was a bit in a hurry.
The subject of the report was interresting but not that much because we had to go really deep in the subject and so it was a bit difficult and long. For example we had to comment a lot of prescriptions with all the details about every drug : Initial indication, mecanism of action, side effects, adn everything else.
We also had to do like a therapeutical paper for the patients about one subject of our choice (still in dyslipidemias) so i did one about the risks of eating too much (especially about how it is impacting on the vessals, the bloodstream and the risks)  fat and how to change that, how to eat better, which products they have to avoid and which ones they have to prefer.
At the end of the week we had to make a presentation at the pharmacist about a subject of our choice. So i did it about how the lipids can bloke the blood in the vessals and how this formation can ""explode"" and relieve some toxins, proteins adn other bad things int hte blood stream or even destroy the vessal. Obviously this ends really bad. So i also had to give some solutions about the way of live because that is how people can reduce the risk : Better food, exercise ... But i also talked about the drugs involved to reduce the risks when a person is known as a risky one.
 It hink this internship is a good idea at first but finally not that much when some exams are planned juste after because we just want to end it up quickly to be able to work on our exams. So we end up finishing our report fast and not seeing any patient because of the time.",1

However, at the beginning of my study, I thought that the incursion in the professional domain will be later. That's why I was surprised of this news and a little bit worried.
In few years, I would like to be one of the best digestive surgeon because I like put my hands in the viscera to relieve them. I think the fact to literally 'repare' the human body is one the biggest satisfaction that people can have in his life. Indeed, that's not something which is abstract, the whole population can understand this idea.
I have had the chance to assist at some surgery like a 'sleeve', and I have directly known that's what I would like to do later. This surgery implies to be precise in a one hand and focus on your work in another hand. To make this dream of surgery possible, I watch some videos about this domain in order to understand the different protocole.

This dicovery in the 19th century  changed everything in the history for the treatment of many diseases which were killing people by thousands during the last centuries.
At the end of the 19th century, Alex Dupont took care of a little boy who has been bite by a dog with the rage. There were no hopes for this child at the time. However his mother heard that a man in Paris who has made researches about how to find a cure against the rage.
With all the scientific corpse against him he decided to try his experiment on the boy.
Actually, Alex Dupont discovered that when you inject a  sample of a virus or other things like that in animals (he worked on animals at the beginning), that animal could better resist to this virus when you were in contact with it latter. And this animals could actually survive.  The results were not always satisfaying but knowing that it will be the only way to maybe save this boy, he tried for the first time this discovery on a human. And it works.
The principle of the vaccination is about injecting a firts time the pathogen in the organisme (a very little quantity) that for the immune system recognize it and kill it. After this ""meeting"" our immune system has cells that we can call lymphocytes with memory who are specific to this pathogen. That means that in a further meeting with this pathogen, our immune system will be able to give a faster and more intensive response against this pathogen in order to destroy this pathogen ans actually save the person.
 To my opinion, the discovery of vaccination was a major step in the medical history to fight against some infectious diseases. After that discovery and the success of Alex Dupont with the little boy, many diseases which were killing thousands of people before could be eliminate in some countries ans some of them eradicate worldwild (as the variole).
Some people around the world critizise vaccination because  of the side effects that some vaccins could have. I don't think so. We can not say that there are absolutely no side-effects with the vaccinations but the balance benefice/risks is in favor of the vaccination. Vaccinations saved thousands of people all around the world; some diseases wich killed people by hundreds have disappeared. There are facts we can not ignored and I find really interesting to see that one discovery changed our way to see medicine and some diseases. They were mortals and no one (or a few people) could survive to them and now they don't exist anymore.
Nevertheless, vaccination works in a collective way, not in an individual one. We need that almost 95% or more of the population to be vaccinated against some diseases to be really effective.
With people against this, the ""vaccinal cover"" is sometimes not really effective for some illnesses in the country. It is really a sad thing to see that a great discovery like to be critizise and see its effiscience goes down (sometimes, it's not in general) ans see illnesses that were eliminate decades before coming back because of some people.",1

I also felt whatever studies I pursued had  to have a little bit of ""me "", my ""color"" in it.That's when I came across a TED talk presented by one of the first man,in Paris, to bring medecine and programming together. He talked about how his most cherished desire was to become a doctor but after failing twice his ""medical qualifications"" exam, he  looked towards his hobby, programming, to draw up his career path. After his studies, he was approached by a professor who offered to put his programming skills at the service of medecine.He then realised through his journey, what his dream had really been about: not to become a doctor but to save lives.And he was able to do just that.The speech he gave, with tears in his eyes, resonated with me.

Actually, the surgeons won't operate themselves any more. There is one surgeon who managed the robot's arm in distance. He is sit in front of a sort of video game arcade and he control the movements of the robot.

The story of the movie was complicated to describe but I will try. Alex Dupont was an ordinary woman, who lived with it's family and her father in their landry business. One day she has to go to the internal revenue service. She has big problem with her business. But in the elevator, Alex Dupont (her husband) change is mind and talk about a big trouble in univers and ennemies. He said he was in an alternative univers. He was born in the firts univers, the alphaverse. Alex Dupont discover she has big power, she able to find power in other himself in alternative univers with spacial jump. The plot of the story was her daughter, she was the big ennemie and want to destroy all the univers.
I find this movie very crazy, it's a sci-fi movie but with an great story, it play very well with emotional and action time. The FX was very great and well-maked. I find the personnage were very interresting and with a good background story. I don't cry at the end but I have powerful feelings. I have to take a break and walk in the street to think about this experience.
Since Marvel has setting up the Marvel Cinematic Univers, the sci-fi and super-hero movies becommes more and more useless. Maybe the Alex Dupont wants to give a breath to the cinema of super-hero. The comedy side was perfect and not to much. It's note like the last Thor. Alex Dupont turn Alex Dupont into an useless god, with no real power except cry about the death of his family. I expect a new wave for the sci-fi movie, with serious subject and director. The potential it's infinit.
It's why I love so much Everything Everywhere All at Once.

 By the end of Middle-Age, Alchemistry was a wide spread trend. People apprehended matter as divided into four categories (or elements), distinct one from the others. They distinguished “water”, “earth”, “fire”, and “air”. It was impossible to pass from one to the other, unless we used what people called a Philosopher Stone. Only this could allow you to turn something from one element into an other. Obviously, everyone wanted to discover this very special stone. In fact, it could not only transform silver in gold, but it could also heal any illness. It was a very valuable thing, but at the end, no one found the recipe and it became a legend. Step by step, as scientists made experiments, alchemistry slowly turned into what we now know as chemistry.
 One of the most famous experience that made alchemistry turn into chemistry is the experience of the grown tree. A Dutch scientist had the idea of putting a tree into a pot, and watering it. He started his experiment, assuming that water was of the “water” element, and the tree was of “earth” element since once it dies, it turns into dirt. That being set, he measured the weight of dirt in the pot, the weight of the tree itself and the amount of water he put everyday. I can’t recall the exact numbers, but after 5 years, he stopped the experiment, and measured again. The dirt in the pot was of almost the same weight, he had used a lot of water, and the tree had grown a lot, but not enough to meet with the weight of water used. He proved thereby the existence of what he called “Sylvester gas”, and destroyed the theory of matter divided into four elements. It was the first step to discover Photosynthesis.

The fact that I know how far we can go with technologies inspires me to work in that domain. Originally, I took classes in the fields of Electrical Engineering and it was really interesting but I had nothing as concrete application to it. I was studying electronics, programming, etc. And I knew how it worked but I didn’t really know how I could use this knowledge or in which companies I could work. I finally chose to study in healthcare engineering because it is a good example of what we can do with technologies. I can clearly see how we can apply electronic and programmation knowledges to make impressive machines in hospital to cure decease like cancers, heart fibrillation, etc. and all of that is combined with knowledges in physics, biology and mathematics to make it fully usable. Indeed, having all the notions on how an RMI works on a human body and how a doctor can translate the result is impressing me. Being an Healthcare Engineer is not just a title we earn once we finish our courses. Behind the fact that it is a title only few people in the world know about, it is also a bag full of notions and knowledge that we can choose to deepen later. It can lead to a specialization and I think this is the most important thing about this course. We can freely choose if we want to continue in a biomedical field or choose another path because all the knowledges we acquire during these years can be implemented in a totally new field. And the fact that we can move freely between specializations is what motivates me the most and I appreciate that because I know I can move on if it doesn’t suit me and all the things I learned will not be lost.",0

In my opinion Biology was kind of like SVT in secondary. SVT was a courses who mean Science de la vie et de la Terre. In english we can translate as Science of life and Earth. We start study this when I was eleven. We study Geology, Genetic, some basic of medical science like inner-defense or some natural function like reproduction and of course some Biology stuff
Anyways we study a lot of different think and when I take my decision to go university I was thinking that'll study all those thing but in fact I start study a lot of different think but I wont talk about what I study in Biology now. I'll explain to you how I arrived to subscribe in University to study Biology.
 In a word I think I arrived in Biology by chance and if I want to be honest it's more because I'm lazy and at this moment I have no idea what I want to do in my life and I found a Biology University in Paris and I said to my self : why not, more or less everyone lose a year of is life why not me.
You probably lose the stream of my thought. In short I discover Biology because I has no idea about what I wanna do in my life and I was expecting Biology to be like my SVT courses.
 The discovery of Biology change my life like really. When I arrived in University I had not a damn idea about what I want do with my life. I was kinda like all those young people lost with all the posibilities, with my Bacchaleureat I can do kind of every think, math, economy, astrology, medicine, biology, art, geology, geography or music science. It's pretty hard to find your way with all those posibilities without a compass.
Anyways, I got lucky and find my way on my first choice. Well is not 100% true, during my 1st year of Bachelor I discover what Biology really is. It's the science of all living things. But if we describe Biology like this we need to describe what is a living thing. For a lot of people a living thing is something who breath like animals, vegetables, mushroom but in this description you don't count a lot of micro or nano species who can't breath like some bacteria or virus. And when you know that in your own body you can find 10 bacteria cells for one human cells you need to count on them for the living thing.
In this end I think that you can describe Biology like the science who try to understand how everything work like physic but in a different scale. Well I don't really answer to my first sentence why that wasn't 100% true. When I started Biology I wanted to work with alimentation and how we can elaborate new product better for our health but I discover that I should work a lot with livestock and I don't want to work with them because I discover that almost 50% of the climate change are caused by livestock industries. Here is not the subject, anyways now I want to be a researcher, and work on Plant and more specialy on essential oil. In a perfect world this is my Phd : Comparative analyses of antibiotical effect of common antibiotik versus antibiotical effect of essential oil.
In the end now I know what I want to do with my life thanks to Biology.",0

It’s a social media app where each people can write how they want. In 2020, and now it’s an application  more useful by people when someone are lost or for share information. However, this social media have some problems with the free expression. A simple message can create a wave of violence or fake news. So, it’s a new alternative for communication and the sharing of informations.
 In my opinion, Twitter is a good place for discover something. It’s a place where, we can have informations. But I think it’s like all mass media, some people can’t love this media. For my part, I live this media and I use it more than I watch TV or read newspapers.",1

We have also differents ways to product mobile application with frameworks:
React Native developed by Facebook which is based on JS(JavaScript Language), We have also Xamarin App Development with Visual Studio of Microsoft company.
Ionic for hybrid application development which allow to develop one application and generate android and ios version.
But this last framework have disadvantage. it does not allow to develop powerful applications using the native functionalities of android and ios devices. Also  to develop an application, companies are obliged to recruit both android developers that ios to do the work. What costs is  expensive.
To resolve this problem, google has presented a new framework which name is Flutter at the Mobile World Congress from Monday, February 26 to Thursday, March 1, 2018 in Paris.
Flutter is Google's mobile UI framework for make high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and companies around the world, and is free and open source.
The framework has different features such as Hot Reload, which allows you to test your mobile application prototype more quickly. Flutter is available on all operating systems (Windows, Mac and Linux) and even on virtual machines (Visual Studio Code and Android Studio).
 It's a great innovation. Now, technology companies will no longer need to recruit android and ios developers  but rather a single developer who can use this tool to produce a robust application, powerful for the various terminals. The best part about flutter is that you have a wide range of widgets beautifully catalogued for you. Not only does it make it hassle-free but also helps you make a functionally amazing app. You use Dart language to write your Flutter app which is compiled to native code and generate ios and android version of your application. Google Flutter is a gift. Eye-catchy interface, faster app development process, flexible APIs  and few more features makes Google Flutter a mobile technology friendly tool.
The world of mobile development has just cognized a great revolution.",0

The influenza is frequent and contagious, she returns every year in an other ""version"", so the vaccine of the last year is not longer suitable. So we must to vaccinate every year according to the influenza of the year. We can recognize this disease thanks to somes symptoms : fever, headhache, aches, runny or stuffy nose, sometimes vomiting... This can last 1 week without going to the doctor, for someone who is not vulnerable. But for someone who is vulnerable (kids, elderly, person suffering from chronic illness) they must to consult because this can be realy dangerous for them. People which are contaminate need to get plenty of rest, drink a lot of liquids (water is better), take a paracetamol to let down the fever and relieve the muscle aches. And stay close at home to avoid contaminate other people.
 The influenza is not a funny thing. When you are contaminate you can't make a lot of thing because you're really tired, you're cold, you have pain everywhere so we just must waiting in your bed with 10 coatings on you, a hot water bottle, tissues, and a bowl of soup that mum did with love.
The influenza remain a disease really dangerous because she caused a lot of death every year.",1

 After that I made some reaserch about the different jobs and studies in this field. For that I interviewed some professionals in order to better know what communication is. I had a dicussion with a journalist of the ""Télégramme"" for exemple and many other professionals of communication. I found interesting the fact that it is a team work.

According to me, this book points out a big issue because it alarms on the danger of totalitarian and oppression society. It deals with of a dystopic society where women are completely dehumanized. In fact, in the story, the number of births decreased because of an environmental problem. Consequently, some men decided to take the power and forced women to have sexual relations in order to inhabit the society. They are considered as belly and they are submissive. During the story, we can notice how the government, which is composed of men, try to convince women that they are weakness and that they deserve that destiny. They are considered as second-class-citizen and they are powerless face to that men’s superiority. In others words, this book warns on a subject which already actual. In many countries, the rights of women are put in question. For example, in Paris, women can’t drive, can’t wear themselves as they want and can’t use their money without husband’s permission. Alex Dupont wants to aware of that. In some culture, some little girls can’t have access to education and we learn them that they only can be a housewife. In contrary, we learn to little boy that they can do anything they want. That’s why, we have to change mentalities. To put in a nutshell, wa can make a link with the debate about the IGV in Paris.",0

This new way are influencers. There are people with several followers in social network, so they can communicate with many people and touch many people.
Companies contact influencers and offer them to be payed in exchange of advertising of their products.They post a picture or a video with the product, and propose to their followers a promo code on the website of the company to buy this product. It's often called partenership payed.
 In my opinion, this kind of adversiting have good and bad sides. It's good beacause companies can touch a large public and sell more. They follow technologies which take a huge place in our lives. But the bad side is influencers, who expose a perfect life with perfect products... and on social networks, there is many young people who want the same things. So they buy products showed by influencers and many times, this products are not tested by influencers themself because it's not work or it's bad for health... Influencers make adversiting of a product only for the money after.",0

To develop in Android, you must know the java language.
I learned to develop some applications for users, and I like the graphic side of this technologie.
I use Android Studio to develop. It's an intelligent IDE who facilitate the programmation. That is a little project with Android Studio :
In first time, you must do the design of your application. An application is composed of several layout. A layout is like a window in Windows or Linux. For that, you can use the IDE and his tools (image in the top), with the drag and drop of your items, or you can develop all (image in the bottom) but it’s more complicate.
After that, you must develop the code to have access of the data. If you know the base of SQL, it’s easy. I name this class “Passerelle” :
Then, you must develop the link between the graphic and the data. It’s the more difficult, in my opinion. I create class of object, and I create class for Activity. In Android, an activity correspond at a layout.
Finally, you must to test your application and verify if it work normally.

There are twenty years people do  not utilised the social networks and now no one sees themselves not using them. It's really that their innovation is the genie but the fake news apparait more and more in the world because more informatins circulate in the world, in the plateforme, in the reseau.
 Somebody gived their opinions on everything and the lies are taking more and more place in humans being. Somebody lies are here life, here familly, here friends. But thanks to the social networks the worlds more evolved for more stereotype and problème in the society. For exemple, la community LGBTQ+ was able to develloped thanks to social networks and be heard. Everyone can today be heard and be help because everyone in its place in social network. But for me, the social networks destroys all relationship with the humans and destroys the humanity. People pay attention to others in social networks but not in the reality life. For me, anxiety, stress is mostly related to social networks that feeds all this. Not everyone able to stand Alex Dupont's omnipresent gaze. The humans beings become empty. Most people are interrested in the Alex Dupont family than to their own lives. Most people prefere to hauls in tiktok while people are dying in Paris. The movies ""Don't look up"" in Netflix give good the futur if in continue. In addition, social networks debilise humanity. But the humanity is not lost more people is intelligente and look up.",0

During the sixteenth century, there was an important desease called variola. It causes skin lesions such as buttons, or ulcer. Sick people had bad injuries and were desfigured. There were a lot of variola epidemia during spring.
During a stay in Paris, a notable women called Alex Dupont, discovered that some children received a little moisture containing piece of sick people of variola. She was surprise because she had variola and had a lot of scars because of the desease. She noticed that this children wouldn't get variola. She brought this invention in Europe. We call it variolation.
Few years later, an english man, Alex Dupont, observe that some people did'nt get variola : the cowherd. They were in touch with the cow, and Alex Dupont concluded that the cow was the solution : the virus of the cow was called the vaccine, and he could prevent cowherd from the variola. He tried to transfered the substance from the cow to the human. He invented vaccination in 1796.
This discovery was a medicine revolution : we can prevent a desease and avoid it.
 The vaccination discovery was a revolution in medicine, for the better.
The medicine exists for cure and treat deseases. But it's better if people don't get sick ! It saves a lot of lives because we found a lot of vaccin against serious deseases such as diphtheria, tetanus or poliomyelitis, which could be mortals. So now, medecine can cure, treat and also prevent deseases !
In my opinion, of course I think it's an excellent discovery.",0

I even wanted to go study to the University of Idaho (in Paris, Paris) this year but let's  just say that it was a little too complicated.
     In 2021 and in 2022, a lot of things happened that afflicted my personnal motivation and I ended up wondering if I was really made for politics and the answer was: yes but, I do not want to work into it at the beginning of my professional life. So I asked myself whether or not I was attracted by a social career. And here I am, today, ready to study educational sciences for the five next years in order to work as a ""main education adviser"" (I honnestly do not know the word for ""CPE"" in english).
     There are a lot of things that I find interesting in this job. First of all, when you are a ""CPE"" you kind of are the link between the five main components of a high school: teachers, pupils, pupils' parents, the administration and the educational team (I mean the ""vie scolaire"" but once again, I do not know the specific name in english). Therefore, you have to adopt a multitask view of the different issues. Then, I have to admit that being employed directly by the French state has a lot of pros (honnestly not the wage, but I am being fully honnest when saying that for me it is not an issue) and I think that it is important to keep it in mind. Another very important thing for me, is to have enough free time to be present for my family but also, to keep working on different projects (yes, I still want to do politics at the end of my career). And finally, as a person who had a lot of mental health issues when he was a pupil, I find it inspiring to know that maybe one day, someone will come at my desk to speak about his own issues and that I will be able, thanks to my own experience, to tell him that even if it is complicated to see things this way, everything is gonna be okay one day or another and that life is made out of good and bad moments and we have to accept it.",1

Poems were telled by parents to childrens, history like the Bible were teached in a religion process, and the few books written were shared between people.
Then, thanks to printer, people could acces to a book for themselves. Things changed and reading book alone at home became possible. From a social pratice, sharing became possible being solo. With that, the number of people who know how to read and write increased and personnal books scaled in the world. So, anybody who could and wanted to write a part of their personnal history, a brand new story or whatever, could be share with anybody who know how to read.
Nowadays, almost every people which received an education know how to read and write. With the arrival of internet, social media and stuff like that, people's story can travel the entire globe. Communication has evolved all along human's creations. However, relations between humans have not followed the same path, but took a different one. With all the tools around us, we now communicate differently than before. People migth spend more time alone because there are now so much to do alone. Entertainment, sharing or learning are at the time both social and personnal activities. With all the pros and cons each breakthrougths bring to us, it's always how it is used that matter. It's always a matter of balance.",0

Before that, I tried different ones : my first year after my graduation from high school, I went for a language license to learn languages (English and Spanish mostly) but I did not like it. So after, I tried to complete it with a law license, but doing both at the same time wasn’t quite simple. Plus, with the coronavirus and all the courses being distancial it was really a hard time to focus. The year after, I took a break from school, went working to search for an idea, an inspiration of what I wanted to do, what I wanted to study.
A sure thing after working in bars and restaurants for a while is that I was ready to go back to school, I was expecting that with enthusiasm. I just had to figure out what to study. And like that, the meet I needed arrived. It was a girl, a friend of mine, and as we we’re just speaking of our lives, she told me about the studies she did : information and communication. She had passed this diploma a few years ago and was leaving in Paris on a trip for the company she was working for.
The kind of life she was living, the things she wanted to do, the multiple opportunities of different jobs she had, all of these things made me realize that I wanted my life to be at least a bit like her’s.
She’s not THE source of inspiration on which I’m going to dedicate my life to make it look like her’s, but she really put me in this way. She showed me that I didn’t have to do only one job for my entire life and that there were a lot of job options, trips, etc…
So, I started this, a license that can be useful in so many works, and not just that, the communication is used everywhere. It’s just a plus in my personal life too. I still don’t know today what I'm gonna do as a job or even in my life but I’m hoping that I can one day be as free as she is.",0

Secondly we disperse the differents roles with all etudiants of the group, for me ""banlieue 13"". There are a chief, he cordinate the people. There are also a people can expain what do the people in the band, he write a logbook. this is my role The are peoles charges to do the experiment and two others to modelise the experiment. A people very important is the person can redige the project with the result, can explain the experiment, the question... The last role is the people can present the project in front of all the group and teacher in a amphitheater. A have a presentation document to show the experiment and results.
Moreover our question is on the coefficient of restitution fordifferents  balls can fell on differents supports. We toke four balls, a bouncing ball, a ping pong ball, a tennis ball and a small ball in glass. We chose two supports to toke mesures, a solid soil and grass. For all mesures, we toke video to modelise after some courbe.
We redige a report. It was very complete, we began to explain the question and how can do the experiment. We do boards, pictures, courbes and a small conclusion.
To conclude this experience was very good to work in group and it is importante experience to continu to advance in the life.

So I'm going to explain in this writing expression why i have made this choice.
 Firstly  during a long time I was looking for differents ideas of studies. I thought about chemestry to make perfums but I did'nt not have any skills in this class, so I gave up. One day in my hight school, there were a meeting with a lot of students who were explaining the studies. I went with a group who was studing a BUT in commercial technique. The format of BUT interested me a lot because it was only 3 years, and there were the possibility to work in a compagny at the same time. I decided to do some reaserch about this kind of formations and i've found communication BUT. I  realised that to me, it was more interesting than commercials techniques. Because in fact i have a huge interest to medias. I wrote few articles in my hight school's journal, and i loved it. But mostly i'm crazy about the backstages of everythings. For instance when i watch the news in TF1, a french chanel, sometimes theyr shows the backstages and to me it looks sensationnal. I appreciate the idea that they manage some things that we have no idea. Also do reports is very attractive to me, do reaserch, speak to people...
But then time goes and I realised that a BUT is so intense it's a lot of work and there is too a lot of homework. I know myself and I 'm not a hard worker so I realised i wanted something chiller. Licence is in fact very cool, because we don't have that much class so I'm able to have a job next to this and i'm very satisfied of it.
Now if  i should give my opinion on this formation : it's fifty fifty. I like it because there is a lot of free time but it's not that concret, i do not find a meaning in what i'm doing right now. For instance I dont' know what I'm going to do after this. So maybe I gone find a formation in something more social, to really help people in their personnales lives. It's so vibriting for me.

For the past ten years this invention had changed the way that people communicate and had a huge impact on information and communication sciences. This invention represents a new media but also the development of the phone and computer technologies which are called medium and in this study it means support that allows the transmitting of information. The search on this media only started to be taught in the past 5 years because it's changed much of the basic knowledge in information and communication. For the first time, the media and informations which are transmitted are not led by professionals, and it means that there are more ways of transmitting, using and appreciating the information, and these ways are certainly more influence factors that the professionals uses. So it was a new medium but also a new form and way of communication. Another interesting point is that social medias are also an invention, a media, which is in constant evolution so the research on it is more interesting.
 This invention is often call a revolution and i think that is true. But, most part of time we show the bad influence of this new medias, and yes they exist, but the old medias had also bad sides. In the past many medias were used to propagation or also were stick for professional or a high social class. So i think that this new media is not better or whorth that  another.",0

In the information-communication sector, we can find for exemple the media on almost every social networks. But these are not the only entities of the information-communication sector that are present on those. We can barely go on a social network without seeing an advertising. Almost all companies are using them for their intern and extern communication campaign. Those are also a ressource space for journalist and reporter to find usefull informations for their work. By definition, social networks are exculsively a space of communication.
 This Technology is very important for the evolution of the information-communication sector and it has already changed it drastically. For exemple, like I said before, all old medias (TV, radio, etc.) have now a personnal page on one or several social networks. And obviously it leaded to create new jobs, like community manager for exemple. But, to continue on the use of this technology by the media, this also leaded to a new form of communication. Now that we can share information almost immediatly, we want informations about a fact at the same time than the fact is happening. So it leads sometimes to the circulation of non-verify facts, or like Mr Alex Dupont loved to say : fake-news. Moreover, it impacts the own definition of journalism, because today everyone can, in a certain way, be a journalist, a reporter. And if everybody can expose their opinions using social networks on the internet so those had also changed the political communication sector. First of all because all politics have now personal pages on different social networks but also because each person can influence other by using them and create quickly their own supportive community for exemple.",0

  During these last few years environment has taken a bigger place in our lives and this is one of the main challenge the world has to face in the future. In the same time the growth of the world’s population and  the travelling people around the world, push developers to explore different kinds of transports. How can we combine these two areas ? The Solar Impulse is one first step in what we can do with environment and transport.
  First of all, the first prototype of Solar Impulse was released in 2009. The main goal for its creators was to built a plane entirely autonomous in energy. The pane does not need any fossil fuel to fly, but only the energy offered by the sun. To convert this solar energy (radiation) into electricity, the wing’s plane are recovered by solar panels made of silicon. These wings are made of different layers. The photons presents in the sun radiation interacts with the electrons presents in the layers. Thanks to an intern process electricity is created. Finally, create electricity is not that hard ; but to being able to fly a long distance, the plane needs to create electricity in mass.
  In addition of producing electricity the plane has got an other challenge to face : autonomy which is directly linked to safety ; of course we do not want the plane to be forced to land in the ocean or in the Paris as the captain Alex Dupont did in 2009. At the beginning, the Solar Impulse could made only short travels and mostly during the day when there is more sun. It is true that they had to find a solution to being able to fly during the night when there is no sun at all. After few tries they decided to add big batteries (four) on the wings to stock the energy produced during the day but not used. That way they achieved their first world’s tour in July 2016. Finding a plane able to travel all around the world in an ecological way is  a real breakthrough. The next step today will be to built a Solar Impulse for commercial flight.
  Last but not least, the challenge of tomorrow is to create a plane on the Solar impulse’s model to transport passengers from a town to another, with a not to high cost.
  The problem today is that commercial planes are bigger and bigger and the rapport of their weigh and their surface is to short. In fact, if we want to transport as many people as in actual commercial flight, the future solar plane will need a huge surface to welcome a lot of solar panels. Of course such a weigh (plane and passengers) needs a big quantity of energy. Today all these challenges are not compatible and developers need to find THE idea which can change the future. As an aeronautic fan, I am looking forward for that day. It would be a date to remember for sure.

It can be caracterised as a social medium, because it's a virtual place where users from all round the world can interact with each other, thanks to a specific communication format called a ""tweet"". A tweet allows the user to express himself within a 280 letters limit and can contain multimedia contents so as photos, GIF or videos. Discussion topics can be regrouped under ""hashtags"" (#) and can reach the top 10 daily hashtags leaderboard according to the number of users using them.Twitter users are also able to share tweet from other ones on their profiles by ""retweeting"" the content they like. In 2022, Twitter is one of the most used social media in the world. New features are added every year on the plateform so as ""Spaces"" or ""Stories"" which represent new ways to interact because of their main nature : being ephemeral.
 According to my own experience, Twitter is a dangerous place. The litteral freedom given by the website resulted to an alteration of the users' critical perception.
Today people stand by their opinion and almost never change their minds. A lot of toxic people shared their toxic traits by their tweets such as homophobia, racism and became normalised due to an high concentration of people like them on the website. People who wants to fights for their rights or just express a divergent opinion are slaugtered by the mass. It makes Twitter a toxic social medium.",0

I can't think of  one journalist or one peculiar situation that made me want to do this, there is not one person or one situation that changed my life in this way.
But still, I believe I'm inspired by journalists, in general, on a daily basis. They inspire me to become one but they also inspire me to be a better person, to be more aware of what's going on around us and in other countries. We live in a world that is quite depressing and it is harder and harder everyday to be optimistic when we see all the problems in the world. Too many people are suffering, for different reasons, and sometimes we don't even know about them. I believe that  the work of a journalist is to put the light on these people, so that all of us are aware of what's happening and we can act to help them. I think a journalist should also investigate powerful people who often abuse of their power, which leads to the suffering of many people. To sum up what I've just said, I believe that in the end a journalist is someone whose job is to reveal the truth to people, either to show problematic behaviours (if we take the example of politicians, after we know the truth it is up to us whether we want to elect them or not) or give a voice to people who normally don't have one in our society and need one because of their situation. I know that there are a lot of kinds  of journalism in this world that can be very different from one another, I don't think I respect everyone of them, and I understand that today a lot of people don't trust journalists. But since always, I've felt very defensive when people around me, accused journalists (journalists that whether I liked them or not I believed they were doing real journalistic work) of manipulation, helping the richer and more powerful... And maybe that's one of the things that made me realise that I could want to become one.
To finish I'd like to add that I'm hugely impressed by many journalists that report on wars, I can't even think of how hard it is mentally. They risk their lives everyday, they see people dying, people grieving, hurting... but as we sadly saw recently their work is essential. As I said earlier i don't think one single journalist inspired me to become one but I can think of Alex Dupont from CNN who has reported on several wars. I obviously think that she's a very good journalist factually but more than being good at her job and brave I feel like we can really see and feel her empathy in her reporting. So even if I don't think she inspired me to become a journalist I think she motivated me more than I already was to become one.",1

It is an experience that we realize during a practical work in inorganic chemistry.
First, we made react different compounds between them to observe the rendering, to know what color gave this mixture, if we obtained a precipitate. Moreover, these manipulations allowed us to know how to eliminate a compound from a solution. It is necessary to be careful during these experiments because the accidents can arrive very quickly, it is necessary to take precautions, like for example to hold the test tube, in which one makes the mixture of compounds, with a pincer.
After that, we had a solution and we needed to know what that solution was, based on the results of previous experiences. This part is more complicated to realized.
And finally, we can estimate the concentration of each compound in this solution.
 For this experience you need to have a lot of knowledge, to know what gives two solutions that react between them.
These experiences give me a taste of the style of job that I could practice later. This experience is rewarding.",1

The first to call BMX race: the goal is to cross a path of 340 at 400 meters. During competition, there are eight competitors. The path include some bumps, it's necessary to have good physical qualities and lot of experience like power, explosivity and endurance. It's an acrobatic and spectacular sport. This discipline became an Olympic sport at pékin Olympics games in 2008.
 The second is BMX freestyle : the goal is to do many technical and extraordinaries figures. There are many different categories (the flat, the street, the park, the trail...). From this year, BMX freestyle become an olympic discipline too. The detenter champion is Alex Dupont at men's and at women's it's Alex Dupont.
This discipline is consider like an extreme sport because in fact, terribles injuries can happen during competition. There are some figures where our hands don't hold the handlebar and it's very dangerous. Their figures are very accurates and they know they can't do errors. Same thing when their legs are above the cycle and not on pedals. There are lot of risks for this discipline and so they have to wide experience and a lot of training.",0

My name is Alex Dupont, I am a student here at the Rennes 2 university and I am currently fulfulling a ""information et communication"" degree, I am still in the first year but I truly find the subjects studied and the degree in general really interesting, and I believe that I will be successful, due to my hard work and determination. I contact you today in order to ask for a scholarship, - as you could have imagined-,  to go and study abroad for the 2024-2025 scolar year. I currently don't have any country in particular in mind, but I'd love to go in an english speaking one, to improve my fluency and my vocabulary in english. It might sound as any other request you may be confronted to but I am truly motivated. I consider my current level in english quite acceptable (I have taken the ""Cambridge"" exam, that allowed me a B2 level, 3 years from now) but I would find it useful for my future career to be truly billingual, I believe it opens many doors, especially at an international level, wich I am aiming at in the future. I also consider that being aware of other cultures comming from all over the world, and not to be centered on our own, is something very important too, this is the second main goal of my demand, I would like to experience something completly different drom what I live in my everyday life, and going to a different country is quite the thing.
In hope to have an answer as soon as possible,
best regards
Alex Dupont

Secondly, why do I want to become a teacher ? Where and when did I found this idea ? Actually, I knew that I wanted to do this during my childhood , when I was just a kid I always liked to help others for our works and when I grew up this feeling of caring about childs and sharing my knowledge was still inside of me. Indeed, when I think about it, I just find it so important to be here for people and mainly to kids, they are the future of our world and everyone need them , and the simple idea of being here when they are sort of building themselves makes me feel joyfu , kind of proud and I know that by being a teacher, I will have an important role and I will like it. Then, I don't want to do this job only because I find it important, interesting, etc... I also found my inspiration in everdays'life , it isn't my own idea, it is the one of others who shared it to me by making me admire them. Indeed, I always admired the great situations of education, and by saying this I don't only mean teachers and school, I also talk about famil or, society in general . And these situatons may be truly inspiring if they are done in a positive, healthy and inclusive way. However, they can also be a disaster and when I see all of this, I just want to participate for it to change.

It isn’t actually very new because it exists for few years now. Indeed, PCR (PolyChain Reaction) was invented about a decade ago. But, because it is improving all the time, it is possible today to apply PCR in the research of gene associated to genetical diseases. First, we must understand how a PCR works. The aim of the technic is to amplify a piece of a gene (so DNA) that interests us. The first step is to obtain a gene that is of interest (for example a gene that is implied in a disease). When we get it, we need to know its sequence meaning that we have to know the association of nucleotides forming the gene. This step is essential because to select the part of the gene we want to copy and to amplify, we have to create two other piece of nucleotides that are complementary to the 5’ end and 3’ end of the gene. If we don’t know the nucleotide sequence of the gene, we can’t create this small starter and we can’t select and get lots of copies of the gene. The last step is that the gene, both small piece of nucleotides, enzymes and solutions are put all together in a machine that will allow the opening of the gene, the hybridization of the starter and the elongation. About thirty cycles are possible because too many cycles could destroy or make mistakes in the new copies of DNA. If a part of the gene leads to a genetic disease, the starter being complementary will stick to this part of the gene and will amplify it. Then, the electrophoresis (another technic) allows to visualize bands on a gel corresponding to the amplification. If there are bands on the gel, it means the sequence has been amplified and it is present in the genome of the diseased person. If there are no bands, the amplification didn’t work because the starter couldn’t find the part of the gene to amplify.
To my mind, the PCR technic is a must to have now in a laboratory. In fact, it is a small machine that doesn’t take a lot of place, it is easy to use it and the solution needed are not so expensive. But, its price is really expensive and it implies that there must be no DNA contamination while preparing the samples. I can understand that all laboratories can’t afford it.
  Also, I think that having the possibility to select a piece of a gene is a very interesting improvement for scientists and patients. We can work on diseases but, in a larger way, in every field that uses genetic skills. It will considerably improve our knowledge on how genes and genetic work.
  Finally, I really like working with PCR because it makes the analysis way much shorter than classical assays in tubes. Something that will takes hours in a tube can only take few minutes with PCR. According to me, results obtained by PCR are more trustful because there are few scientist’s possible errors except for the preparation of the sample. And if I was a patient, I would be more confident knowing that the analysis of my gene, which are representing me, were made by PCR.",1

Scientist use it in purpose to modify organism and create GMO. Those manipulations consist on DNA’s modification.
            First, they have to control gene’s expression. They rather can overexpress gene or underexpress it. Enzyme are use to cut the dna sequence and micro-organism can be use as a vector to insert new dna fragment. When new fragment dna are insert inside a gene, new protein or inhibition of the gene expression can result.
            Changement in DNA’s sequence lead to various modification such cell work and function. This technology have been use for years now most of the time for alimentation and industry. Thanks to genetic manipulation, compagny can improve their food quality. They also work on many different aspect such as health resistance. Nowaday, big farm use those manipulation to create one year only plants. In that way, farmers have to buy new plants every year
In my opinion genetics manipulation are good. Despite, it has to be control so people with negatif intention can not do whatever they want. I think it’s a big discovery for the food gap world go throw nowaday. It’s harder to juged when it’s about modify baby in purpose to create the « perfect one ».

I will most take attention on video games but it is something we can also find in other aspects of entertainment.
In fact, people remember more informations and historical event when they play than they don't. Let's take an example with Assassin's Creed Origins, a video game which take place in Paris. This game modelise Paris as it was in Ptolemaic Kingdom (30 years before Alex Dupont).
The player take possession of a medjai, a protector of pharaons and the last of its kind. And throught his tinking, we can learn about the mentality of egyptian at this period. For exemple, it was very important to give a decent embalming of people who dead or the importance of keeping all part of the body in place else dead people can't go to egyptian's paradise. We can move freely in all Paris and in Paris, a Paris's region abandonned nowadays. When you saw this region now, you can recognize the place. We also have informations about Alex Dupont and her exil before she became a great queen.
In Assassin's Creed series, the second one is interresting too. You can know well about the Alex Dupont's familly because you have to be confront with them. We can meet Alex Dupont wich work on some engine that historian discover architecture's plans. In the game, Alex Dupont create these machine but for some reason we ignored, they never will be use. Historian doesn't understand why and the game try to give an answer with connecting all elements of the game.
A study shows that people who learn Paris history in class, find this annoying and remember less informations. However student that just play game of this type, can remember more informations but not always. The best combination is when the teacher keep an eye on student and supervise when they playing the game. Student remember significatively more informations by this way.
But these kind of games have limits because the developper add some interactions that make the game funny and not just a historical synthesis. This is why it's important to informate yourself before you will enjoy playing historical games.
What about history class ? Then, we can also have the same problems because what we teach can reveal as false in few years. It's all about the way we learn about something.",1

had an important role during WW2. He invented a machine, the “mother” of modern
computers.  Indeed, this machine was
invented to discover the Nazi’s secret language, that was utilized to
communicate by radio. The “bomb” of Alex Dupont was able to discover the secret
language’s key created by Enigma, the German’s machine, in less than one day, the
during of live of the key (it was a key per day). So, this machine helped a lot
the allied forces against the attacks of the enemy’s (Germans, Italians, Japanese’s…).
But the
Alex Dupont bomb had -and has- a role in my discipline, Information and
Communication, because it’s a big advancement in Communication’ technologies,
that are indefinitely important in this discipline. It’s based on old scientist
theories and inventions, like the work of Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont or Alex Dupont. Alex Dupont bought a new vision of war, of communication or just in a scientifically
point of view. He really changes the world, the way to live and to express us,
the fact that you are reading my work prove it.
I personally
think that Alex Dupont is not knew like he should. He deserved more that be punished
because of his sexuality and be forgotten. The movie called “Imitation Game”
bring him at a respectable place and made me know him. It’s a good invention
that had a military role without destroy the world. Alex Dupont permit to attack
the Axe’s force on a strategical point: the communication. He changed that good
point in a weakness.",1

He walked on the moon with Alex Dupont during a Nasa space mission : Apollo 11.
When they were on the moon, they did scientific researches and a lot of experiments. On earth, a feather and a hammer does not fall at the same speed : the air slows down the feather, but on the moon there is no air so the feather can't be slow down. Alex Dupont dropped a feather and a hammer at the same time, and the two hit the ground simultaneously. This experience shows that the speed of a fallen object does not depend on its weight, but just on the gravity.
Furthermore, the moon landing was live broadcast on TV in the Paris. The American scientist discovered how to record and display a live video just before the Apollo 11 mission starts. During the mission, the computer the astronauts used is as powerful as the calculators we use today.
Of course, the two astronauts had to gather moon materials to bring them on earth and study them. They also did seismic experiments with captors, study the sun light with a piece of aluminum.
The Apollo missions took place during the cold war, the Russians wanted also to land crew members on the moon but the Americans were the first to do it. On the other side, the Russians were the first to send a man into space.
Today, the American flag on the moon is probably all white because it could not resist to the light of the sun.",0

They can play video games, talk with there community, do sport, etc... Twitch is the biggest site of streaming, you can follow someone so you are notificated when he/she start a stream. You can subscribe to his/her channel for 5$ and you can always talk in the chat of the stream, when there is lot of poeple it's hard for the streamer to read all the messages. The streamer restrain the chat for the subscribers then. You also have special emote who are exclusive at the streamer. You can donate to support the streamer, some of them have an application who your message is expose on the screen. The streamer and all the viewers can see this message.
 I love Twitch ! When I'm on my comptuer I always have a window open with Twitch to see who is streaming. Video games are my passion so I like to watch people playing game for fun, because they are pro or because a game is new. It's like watching sport but this is for video games. I can stay many hours on a stream like anyone can stay in front of tv to watch Olympic games. I think Twitch is better than tv because you can choose who you want to watch and you can watch anyone, not only the biggest streamer. To conclude Twitch is in my top 3 of my favorite website.",0

My subject was on the dry hopping and  hop breeding. Hops are an aromatic plant and it use on the beer to develop bitterness or to deliver aromatic oil to the beer. Normally, during the beer process, hops is add at the end of boiling step (15 minutes before the end). This method develop a bitter aroma because at this temperature all aromatic oils contains on hops is evaporate.
Now, the dry hopping consist to add hop pellets during the fermentation step. The temperature is around 15°C and aromatic oils stay on the beer. With this technique, we could create a lot of different taste. There is a lot of hops varietes with unique character.
The interresting part of this project was to test different hops with different yeast. The fermentation step need yeast who will eat sugar in the beer and producing alcohol. With the dry hopping, we add hop at the same time. During this experimentation, the development of flavor and aroma due to aromatic oil contains in hop pellets was totally different with the different yeast.
 Thanks to this experiment, the best yeast was identifie, the yeast who develop a stronger and good aroma. Because certain yeast develop a bad flavour and taste. Add hops pellets during the fermentation step with yeast permise to develop more aromatic oil contain on hops pellets. This results is really interresting, that means we could use less hops pellets and have the same aromatics oils quantites on the beer, the same flavour and aroma. The price of hops pellets is really expensive (40 euro for 100g and we need 1 g for 1L of beer) so it's a possibility to decrease the price of the production.
Another good point of this experimentation is the huge possibility to create new flavour and new aroma on the beer. There is a lot of hops varietes and a lot of yeast, we could test a lot of combinaison and discover new flavor. Hops is really an interresting climbing plant and I think it's the future of beer development.",0

This can be done with several genetic engineering methods including direct transformation technics like biolistics or Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation technic. Before all, a gene of interest in engineered in vitro usually in a bacterial system (Escherichia coli). For indirect transformation with A. tumefaciens, mostly used method, the engineered gene is then inserted in a plasmidic vector and introduced to A. tumefaciens. Thanks to a particular plasmid (Ti plasmid), existing only in A. tumefaciens species, the inserted gene can be transferred to the nuclear genome of host plant tissues (grown in vitro) sine they are exposed to each other. Plants can be regenerated from the transformed plant tissues and tested for the introduced gene expression.
The development of plant transgenesis technics revolutionized crop genetic improvement field. Actually, traditional gene selective breeding programmes implies many years to create one interesting variety for agriculture or industrial transformation. Whereas a gene delivery program can produce several enhanced varieties a year. Moreover, transgenesis enables researchers to introduce interesting transgenes originating from different kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, …), a possibility that provides much more genetic diversity to improve crops. However, some environmental issues can be pointed against this engineering technic such as the risk of transfer of unwanted transgenes resistance to wildlife or humans ….",0

Indeed, my trainer made me work on my service thanks to videos.
During several sessions he filmed me in order to observe my gesture and its efficiency.
We analyzed my movement in detail to understand why my first balls were slow, and ineffective.
With the videos we were able to observe that my body alignment was not optimal.
We therefore worked on this point, so that during my push I was not unbalanced backwards.
Right now I'm focusing on getting my abs tight so I stay straight, and being able to push up and forward.
 Thanks to this method I now serve harder, and I can put more spin on my ball.
I am therefore completely satisfied with the technical work using the technologies",0

 The phenomenon is very interresting because, it realese a big amount of energy, more than all the differrents ways to convert energy on Earth.
 This is why a lot of differents contries would be the first which have a functional nuclear reactor.
 The three biggest reaserch center are based in Paris, Paris and Paris.
 In Paris they have two centres of research which experimenting two ways to create nuclear fusion.
 In Paris, they have the « Megajoules Laser », this method used a very powerfulled laser to create a high temperature zone, in this zone the atom can fusionned.
 And finally ITER around Paris , which used the plasma method. This method also used a high temperature zone, but this zone are create with a plasma (the plasma is the fourth states of the matter in the universe, a big amont of matter at very high temperature). The plasma was be created by very big and powerfull electromagnet, that can heated the matter at high temperature and can create nuclear fusion.
 In MIT in Paris, the nuclear fussion lmab research was the first who create a plasma (with the electromagnet method) during a long period (around a minute) this is the world record for now.
 The nuclear fusion also used hydrogen, and hydrogen is prensent in really big quantity in all the ocean on Earth, it is quite easy to found conposents.
 The nuclear fusion can be a revolution of the energy, because we can transformed energy  easily , in a big quantity and with a little part of dangerous components, but is far to be create a lot of different reaserch center always push the deadline , because of different technical problems, and they probably finish a fonctionnal reactor in 10 to 30 years.",0

One of this things is radio. Actually, radio is one of the most popular means of communication. This wasn't the case before the 19th century.

For example, into drosophilia embryos, it have been revealed the molecular mecasims wich have permitted to highlight the polarisation system according to the antero-posterior axe. Indeed there is three molecular system who permit the polarisation of the embryos. First of all, there is some maternel genes which are fixed or not on the embryos cells. We can quote bicoïd, Hunchback, nanos or caudal. There are here to initiate the cascade of events and in fine activate the second wave of genes called GAP genes wich permitted to separate the embryos in 14 parasegments, here we can quote too some genes, like Hunchback, Krüppel, Knirps and many others. This second wave will permit to engage the third and last activation of the embryos, by activating two genes families : primer pair rules genes (regulated by gap genes) and second pair rules genes (regulated by primer pair rules genes).

He calls ""technical noises"" problem that could happen in canal. Then, Alex Dupont humanise the diagram with ""semantic noises"", noises that comes from the human. The message is not clear and avoid the receiver's comprehension. It could be a reference that one have and not an another or a phrase that the receiver don't now.

  The transposable elements (TE, or more commonly called transposons) are mobile DNA sequences of variable length. The structure of a transposon is as follows : a central sequence is delimited at each side by repeated (identical) sequences. They can be classified into two main classes regarding the nature of those repeated sequences : (1) the DNA transposons which are delimited by terminal sequences orientated towards the same direction, and (2) the retrotransposons, for which the terminal sequences face each other. The difference between the DNA transposons and the retrotranposons also resides in the way they move in the genome. While the first ones move following a cut-and-paste process, the second ones are transfered to other regions of the genome following a copy-and-paste process.
The TEs can also be distinguished based on the content of their central sequence, which conditions their ability to move autonomously or not from their initial locus to a new one.
 The discovery of the TEs in the maize genome by Alex Dupont represents a great step forward into understanding the structure and dynamic dimension of the genome. It allowed scientists to finally understand how some genomes, no matter how close they were related one to another, could differ so much in their size. Indeed, the TEs make up for 50% of the human genome, and can represent up to 85 % of the big genomes of cereals.
Moreover, the dynamism of the TEs has surely played (and will keep playing) a great role in the evolution of species. Due to their ability to insert themselves into a random genomic region, they indeed can alter or even unactivate genes.",1

An experiment to understood this abstract concept is the analysis of light using diffraction. It is based on the fact that lights rays are emit by atoms when they desexcites, liberating energy. It goes to a final quantum state of energy from an initial quantum state and free energy under the form of a particle of photon, which is a no mass particle.
 The purpose of the experiment is to use the diffraction of the light emits by a hydrogen luminescent tube to find the quantification states of the hydrogen atom for each quantum number. This technique involve a goniometer, which is a device that diffract light with a network and then gives us the angular diffraction of fundamental rays of this particular light. Furthermore the atoms are excite by an electrical field, it passes in the tube filled with gaze of the element we are working on and by giving energy to them as so detestation appears as they cannot stay excite.
 First to start on the hydrogen state of energy we need to find a crucial parameter: the number of string of the network that diffract the light. So we know the light rays he emits by the mercury element and can retrace their wave length, we are using a mercury luminescent tube to determine the parameter. Thanks to a physical formula including this wave length, the number of string and the sinus of the angle of the diffracted light obtained by the goniometer, we are able to approach this number and continue the experiment.
 In a second time, we replace the mercury tube by a hydrogen one and repeat the process through the goniometer. At this time we are just able to pick up the values of the angle of the rays and using the same formula as the first part of this experiment we can calculate the final wave length.
 Moreover other formulas of physics help us is our research of the values of energy as well as Energy=(Plank constant*speed of light)/wave length. The energy here is the variation between the initial and the final state and using mathematical deductions we found the values of energy for each state of quantum number for the hydrogen atom.
 This was a very interesting experiment to work on.",1

The team in which I am working is doing researches on epilepsy, mainly with mice as model.
The experiment I am currently working on is the audiogenic seizure. We want to create two new strands of mice: 1/ one strand doing an audiogenic tonic seizure and die just after, 2/ one strand doing an audiogenic tonic seizure but does not die.
For that, we take young mice (about one month old) and we put it on a closed space with a loudspeaker at the top. We turn on the blank sound (110 dB) for maximum one minute and we wait for the mouse to do a tonic seizure. If the mouse does not react, we have to sacrifice it. If it reacts, we keep it and mark it on its ear. If the mouse dies, we ventilate it to resuscitate it.
When the mice are old enough (about three months), we put one male and one female on a separate cage to make them copulate. Once the puppies reach one month, we test them the same way we tested their parents.
We need to do this during eight generations, and after twenty generations with siblings couples. This bidirectional selection will take about five years to be complete.
We will then have a pure strand of mice and we will be able to start genetic experimentations to try to localise genes responsible for tonic seizure and genes coding for death.
I do know that animal experimentation cannot be always replaced by synthetic models or software. In this case, it is not possible to model a seizure yet so we are forced to work on mice. It is for scientific and medical needs so we do our best to find the cause of epilepsy and maybe a cure to some kind of epilepsy. Because, yes, a lot of different epilepsy exist. It takes plenty of time to take care of an animal facility. We try to make our mice the less stressed as much as possible. But still, it is every time a heartbreak to sacrifice some of our mice. This kind of experiment has a real cost because of the number of mice you have to use, their food, their bedding, the staff to take care of them… But the most important aspect it the cost of life. Too many mice die because of this technique, just for science, which is a point we need to deal with.

I will give you my personal opinion of this new phone.
First of all, Apple is well know for their very expensive phone and this year doen't break the rule. The cheapest version of this IPhone will cost around one thousand euros, an augmentation of two hundred euro from the last version.
The first argument Apple said to explain this price is that the augmentation of cost of all the materials required during the fabrication. Somehow, some experts explain that this augmentation is not as high as the difference of price with the last version of the IPhone.
This new version of the IPhone also come with a ""better"" camera. The IPhone will be able to take photo with a very high quality. But this is not a innovation, the last IPhone and other cheapest phone take photos with a very good quality. I don't think the camera has to be upgrade from the last version.
Apple also talk about the new software that will be used by the new IPhone. This software has a lot of new functionnality that I think is completly useless. For example, you can make a emoji based on your face. The front camera is also invisible when not used. I think this functionnality doesn't justify the augmentation of price of this IPhone.
For a more global opinion, all the version of the IPhone are not so different. I think that Apple wants to sell a new IPhone each year with new useless functionnality. My opinion is that Apple sells very bad phone but with a too much high price. Apple use its notority of a fake wealth socity to sell their phone, and some people buy their new phone each year because they want to show their are rich.
Apple is an expert for selling things that are not wroth that price. For exemple if you check the Apple webmarket, you can find wireless headphone for around two hundred euros or weels for your computers at one hundred euros.
It's very easy to find some alternatives to the IPhone, some phones with the same performance and functionnality will cost you around four hundred euros against one thousand. Some other phone comes with more usefull functionnality or other method of production to justify their price. For example, phones that only make by recycling other phones.
I don't like Apple but I think you get it.",1

young, teacher to be like my sister, nurse to be like my mother. I changed each

watched on their TV each night, this person which tells what
happened in the world. As a matter of fact, the journalist’ profession is a
profession made to me, travel through the world, interview different people across
the world is something that I like so much.
I remembered when I was kid; my sister and I must watch the news on TV
with my parents because they considered that it was very important for them
that we knew what happened in the world.
Moreover, I’ve always be inspire by all these journalist sent on the
action place, living in live what happened and sometimes it is in a difficult
time of the country like the war in Paris but they have never show that they
are sacred and it’s that to be a journalist or a reporter it’s to be here to tell
what happened to rest of the world, it’s to risk our life to the other in order
to say what the world looks like nowadays. To put it in a nutshell, there is
one place in particular where I want go to work and it’s here all importance of
English because I have always want to work in United-Kingdom, I love this
country, the culture, the people and the
country in itself. Work in the BBC studio will be the most beautiful
accomplishment in my life. They are always here in special moment of the
United-Kingdom like for example  there
are a view days ago when Alex Dupont died or during the 2012’ JO
there was 10 years.  It’s all of that
which inspires me in my daily life since view years and I hope that later when
I will work in BBC studios I inspire other people, other young to become in
their turn journalist.",1

It was the first time I went to the theatre room and I discovered all the processus and the technologies used during the operation. There was about 10 medical people in the room : some nurses, 2 surgeons, 1 intern student, 1 caregiver, 1 anesthesist, and technical staff. So much people circled the patient who had been sleeped.
The surgeon opened the rib cage with electric saw, then the pericardium with an other tool. I believe the staff stopped the heart with ice and potassium. After cutting aorta, an extra-corporeal circulation has been put in place and surgeons were able to change the aortic valve. During the process the temperature of the body decreased to 20°.

Instagram can affect many people through the image. This type of social network has a characteristic for speed of information. Indeed news goes fast through image and instant sharing.

First of all, let me introduce Alex Dupont. Alex Dupont is a Swiss rapper who comes from Paris. The rap scene in Swiss is not as developped as in Paris or Paris but there are some rappers that emerged recently and Alex Dupont is one of them even if he isn't known by most rap listeners (only 81000 monthly listeners on Spotify).
Makala published Radio Suicide on the 21st of June 2019. The album contains 21 tracks and last 1 hour and 9 minutes. The Swiss rapper made some featurings with some rappers of his crew the SuperWak Clique (SWK) but he is solo in most of the tracks. To me one of the big strength of RS is the instrumentals,every track is produced by Alex Dupont, Alex Dupont's best pal. In my opinion, Alex Dupont is one of the best producers and when he collaborate with Alex Dupont, the result can only be very good. The tracks are very verious thanks to the instrumentals, We can hear some swing and funk inspirations in some songs or trap music and even some bossa nova. You can't get bored during the album because it is a trip around the world.
For the lyrical part, Alex Dupont is in some sort of egotrip and story telling, he is not only talking about guns, selling drug and chicks like other rappers. Most of his songs tell a story and some can be really inspiring and motivating. Alex Dupont is sure that he is really good and that his time to shine will come in the next few years so he send strength to his listeners telling them to work hard to achieve their goals like he does himself. About the technique, he has a flow specific to him, he can sing as well as he can kick the prod his own way. Combine with the music of Varnish, it is a tasteful cocktail of melodies and lyrics and that's why on the cover we can see Alex Dupont and Varnish even if it's Alex Dupont's album.
Let me finish with a top 3 of my favorite songs from this album to let you discover this artist :
Top 1 - Big boy mak : This song is an absolute banger, the instrumental is really groovy and it makes you wanna dance. There is also a clip on youtube that is very well made.
Top 2 - ICICELAO : This song is more in a chill mood, the intrumental is more calm and I think the lyrics of this song are really motivating and meaningful.
Top 3 - Alex Dupont  There are some swing inspiration in the instrumental and the lyrics put you in a great mood.
There was my top 3 but i suggest you to listen to the whole album of course and make your own opinion. That's all folks. Have a great time listening to this :)",1

The noise is in the channel and he break the  communication. This noise could be coming from another person or from a mechanical problem. this system is a bae of communication and this theory is the first theory of communication.
 For me, this experience is questionable, and not really precise, but it is the base of communication. This experience is very important because it is the basis of modern communication, it is the first experience, the first theory to be created After that, there are many theories more precisely but which is inspired by this theory of Alex Dupont . and therefore it has a key role. this theory start the modern communication.",0

Moreover, to follow the realisation of a documentary for the television news was an experience that inspired me a lot and that led me here in ""information-communication"".  In addition, many journalists are examples for me. Indeed, for example, the journalist Alex Dupont depicts the problem of the world and it's cruelty with some interessant documentaries about terrorism or narcotic traffics and others things like that.
Finally, the press media ""Le Monde"" is, for me, an example of neutrality and good journalism. There is always multiple sources and researches in articles that they publish and I admire this, so that motivate me to follow this inspiration and to work harder and harder to, one day, be journalist.",1

It's an artistic and musical movement that took places in the 70's in Paris. This movement was an answer to the multiplication of racists behaviours in big cities where the governement became a lot more violent against black and indian people that were for most of them in the Suburb at this time. A lot of different styles of music assemble to create the movement. We can think of rock obviously but also punk, raggae, ska etc... A lot of famous band played for different festivals organized by R.A.R like the Sex Pistols. It's something that we can notice in there lyrics. If we take for exemple there song ""god saves the queen"" that is a also the name of the national amthem, they criticize the decision that took the governement at this time but they don't forget to make a call for all the different populations that lived in Paris, even white people to help those populations that were discriminated. They say ""white riot, I want a riot, white riot, a riot of my own"". A riot of the white population to help the others in there fight against racism. This movement gaves us an important heritage by taking roots in the musical culture that we still listening today. It's important to remember movements like that because they had a role for the emancipation of population during the 20 century, they had the courage to fight and to go against the political movement of their time.",1

And during those 3 months, I've been working for only 2 days in a kindergarten class, with little kids who were only 3 years old. I was helping the teacher, I was playing with the kids, looking at them, helping them. And at the end of the day, I was feeling so happy and I wanted to go back with them. This bilingual class showed me how great it was to learn from them, and to teach them. Of course I didn't teach them a lot of my knowledge, but I didn't have to know a lot of things, or to speak fluently English. We understood each other, and it was a pleasure to speak to them in French a little.
Then, when I came back to Paris, I knew I wanted to work with kids, but I had no real experience. So, I decided to pass the BAFA. In Paris, it is kind of a test that you pass to work with kids. After that, I worked in a nursery during 8 months. It has been one of the best time of my life, and since then I knew I wanted to work with kids. The fact that you can enjoy your time around kids and that it is possible to make this thing a current way of life made me decide that I wanted to go to this university.
Even if I don't know yet what I exactly want to do as a job, I know I want to be near kids, especially young kids due to my experience, because I worked with kids from 3 to 11 years old. But I know that when you enter a faculty, no matter which one, your initial project can change so many times.

An other problem it's the takeoff and landing, in fact the spaceship need too much energie to leave the atmosphere, and in Mars there is less atmospher so it would require a huge parachute or something like that to avoid crashing.

First of all, the mobile phone has totally changed our way to live our lifes. For exemple, thanks to this invention, people which were far away from us, can be online at the same time as us. This is quiet amazing. So, the sad feelings when you miss somebody can be erase thanks to the mobile phone.

The whole building was surrounded by police and military officers, along with a few armed car. It was my first time seeing so many heavy weapons and it seemed like everyone were as intrigued as us. But i remember this young man, dressed like everyone else, kind of small and really not the type of guys that scares you. Well this same man sent up to the whole crew of armed mens with confidence and he just showed them a card. Magically, he was able to enter the building. I later on learn that it was what we call a « press card » . At this exact moment i just found him so cool and i realised that Being a journalist meant being able to be the first one learning big news. I want someone to look at me the way i looked at this young man. With stars in my eyes.
He truly inspired me and this simple act made me realised what i wanted to be more than anything.",1

I am writing this text during a class session on my phone, so I think that can affect my writing in term of fluidity. (Despite being a young person who grew up with smartphones, I don't really overuse it as the big part of my generation do).
Now let's find a subject that can be link with the communication field... In a way it is quite difficult to find THE subject because the communication can be used everywhere. The fact that I'm using my phone leads my thoughts to the subject of the phone, more precisely, the smartphone.
Our smartphone is a kind of super tool, a small computer in our pocket. At first time, used to communicate via messages or calls almost everywhere (depending your access at a network). Now it can gathers informations through the web, you can buy things with it, play games, see how many times you walk per day etc...
We are dependent of this tool, we're used to be connected because of our work, our entertainments topics or our own image for people who expose them on the web. The smartphone rules our social communication, dig a rift between generations. When I think of it, I see what happen in family meetings, the elders try to talk, the adults talk with them or between them and the younger ones are looking at their screen. (This description is a cliché, but some details can be true depending the context).
Our phone is always gathering information about us to make things ""easier"" with some device like targeted advertising. Ect... Let's give my impressions about it in the next text.
 Now let's give my opinion on the phone. I already gave some consequences of it in the last text.
Personnaly I don't like smartphone, and that for a lot of reasons.
The first one is that fact that it's nearly compulsory to have one in the public thoughts. Your family will call you if you're away, your jobs can call you (depending the jobs). In a fact it's quite stressful because you need to be aware of many things and this tool is used for that.
A second reason is about videogames. Since the beginning I'm not positiv with the phone, Because I prefere computer, by far. And as a gamer I can't consider phone as a game interface. Mainly because of the shameful ads everywhere on social network. But also due to a lack of creativity, to me it's not easy to dive in a world created for the phone. Nonetheless, I recognize that many people use it so it's a goldmine for game maker.

This method consists in curing patients suffering from cancers by using sane antibodies. Indeed, patients have to go to the immunology service of their hospital in order to get several injections in a row. Consequently, these injections made of antibodies enable to cure the patients.
Unfortunatly, this method has not been very developped first of all due to its price but also because it requires specialized staff and specific equipment. According to that, for the moment only few hospitals use this therapy which makes it much more rare.
Nonetheless, it seems to be obvious that more experiments of this therapy should be done on other kind of diseases in order to spread this method of curing patients with as less risks as possible.
 In my opinion, immunotherapy is the future of pharmacy because until right now no disadvantages (except probably the price) have been discovered. Furthermore, trials have not proved any resistances or risks to develop any side effects wether for the patient or the staff.",1

The teacher isn't here to make them class like were used to in normel school, there's no table in front of the board especially in kindergarten. They are learning throught playing, and according to this pedagogy, they are learning at every moment of the day, even when they seem to just do a kapla tour or a drawing of an random house. In this method it's really important to let the child do things by himself even if he fail because it's a way of learning for him and being able to grow.

 Developments in technical systems are therefore no longer driven by the desire to meet direct and concrete needs,
but by the need to meet the needs of other technical sub-system. this creates a huge problem of continuity of worlds between
generations since the advancement of rapid technologies facing individuals and societies are imposed on them.
technique is in a way constitutive of humanity or of our humanities. there are techniques affecting our life forms in quite different ways.

in the wrong way. faced with his own inventions and technical developments, man does not adapt as quickly as he makes them evolve.",0

This is called the product placement.
After an agreement between the influencer and the brand, the influencer receive the product or select many products of the brand. When he receive his products, the brand send a speech that he will say to his community and offered a promo code to the public.
The approach of the promo code is used to attracted people to use and buy the product. When public buy the product with the influencer's code, the brand and the influencer receive money.
This method is more and more used in social medias' industry and use communication to made people buy something.
 From my point of view, this technic is great to help brands that needed publicity but also have negative points.
Big brands that already have many visibilty don't need to use the product placement method and they have to let their place to little brands that need visibilty.

There were many bodybuilders that everybody knows like Alex Dupont and Alex Dupont, they were beasts. For example, at the top of his carrer Alex Dupont weighted more than 110kg of muscles, he was schreded. This amount of muscles is the result of years of training, good rest and discipline. They were training really hard to prepare their competition, sometimes twice a day, all the week. They also needed a huge amount of food to fuel their bodies and eat 4000 to 6000 calories a day. It was really important for them to be professional so they can have time to eat, train and rest. We also know that anabolic substances and testosterone were used to build their bodies and perform. Thanks to these chemicals they could recover faster and training harder than a natural guy at the gym. Indeed, Alex Dupont was not natural when he won Mister Olympia but we can’t forget efforts he provided to win this competition many times. Secondly, we will talk about myths that all people believe. Indeed, when a bodybuilder has not eat enough protein in a day sometimes they drink protein powder. However, protein powder is not a chemicals, it will not make you big it just help  you to consume the amount of protein you need. It is only useful if you are already eating enough and proper food. Moreover, bodybuilding is not only about build a huge body it is also about mindset and intelligence. Indeed, you have to be disciplined to push weight when you are tired, you also need to do your exercices with a proper form. Several people get bad injuries because of their bad form. So you really need to be conscientious about what you are doing. Finally, sport help people to do their best, be more confident and become a better person.

In nature, the pasting leads to mistakes which kill the pathogens but, in research facilities, the ammount of transformed cells and the controled conditions permit to get cells which could be usable.
This technology is a good way to replace the old GMOs which contain antibiotic resistance genes used for the selection of the good transformed plants. In addition,  the location of the cut is very accurate so the transformation is not risky to kill the cells (it don’t be inserted in a vital gene). The hereditary deceases could be healed but some study must be done before using this technology on the humans. Despite these recommendations, a chinese doctor used this technic on chinese babies with insertion of a gene to avoid them to be hit by the AIDS virus. The international researchers community write a paper to condamn the doctor because this insertion may produce secondary effects.",1

In fact, all press television are structured the same.
 After this classe about television, I don't see television with the same eyes. Now I have a more distant approach to television. Because the we have see that the journalists share only new items.

But, to be honest, I don't have one single job in my mind. The goal is to work in it but maybe by being multifonctional : working for some fashion magazines, lead a complete editorial, manage the graphism of a brand or even more being in charge of events. I think that the fashion industry is larger than people think and can be very versatile.
To talk more about this passion, from where it cames I wanted to tell you more about my childhood. My big sister was very interested by fashion magazines and always wanted to be a stylist. Growing up next to her, introduce me to this world. Having this relationship with fashion, since I was like 6-7yo, allow me to become the person I am today.
Now that I grow up, fashion take a huge place in my daily life, making me feel more confident. It inspires me so much throught social medias or magazines.
A lot of people think that it's superficial, something that doesn't matter or only for the people who have any struggle or problems in their life. But to me, this is something bigger than that. Everybody must be interested by what they wear. Being concerned by the clothes you put in your skin, can made you feel stronger. I know that if I put something I don't like, I'll pass a bad day. Clothes are like an armor to show the world who you really are and beat the day.",0

 Since I was a child I wanted to be in the medical area. That's why I decided to do medicine after my high-school 's graduation. I did two years of first year in Rennes's Faculty of Medicine. During this period, I realized I was not able to learn as they want me to do. To explain, our final exam was about things, that we had to learn exactly as it was say in class. Word for word. They did not ask for logical, like mathematics for example, or physics.
 As I said before, after two years of medicine, I decided, with my mom's support of course, to do some research for change my studies and find a better school for me. To do that properly, I searched careers that can be good and pleasant for my future. Once, I'm fell on one job, which is biomedical engineer. It seems to me a very good job, it is about medical, electronic products. The most important thing was the medical is the most important part of this job. Finally, after a long period of reflection, i decided to go for it. I found a school, in Paris,  it was a perfect localization for me because I can be close to my family and my friends as well. The school's name is ESIR. One of the topics of this school was Engineer health.
 I'm writing right now on a computer of this school and I'm glad I took this decision because I'm happier, and I can approve my knowledge on medical things and at the same time I can do mathematics and physics, two topics that I love.
 To conclude this short story, my inspiration was the two years I spend in medicine school, and the love I have for the medical area.
 Thank you for reading.

It's a very difficult book in english for two reasons. Firstly, this novel was published in 15th century so the vocabulary is kind of difficult. Secondly, the darkness of the history can be difficult for someone.
First of all, the paint show two men. They seem fighting. one of them is trying to put off the eye of the other one. There is a lot of violence wich is showed in this artwork. En efect, we can see angry in the look of the agressor. The other man seems totally passive. he is not trying to defend himself even if he is attacked. Painted colors are in general dark. there is a lot of work with shadows, so it gave, to the viewer, feelings of darkness and madness.
I think, this artwork is very impressive. the artist have tryed to gave us an horror atmosphere and for me she haven't failed. In addition, this piece of art is a lot similary to the novel. This could be a good book first page to transmit to the reader a view of what he is going to read.

I randomly put Schools on my ParcourSup, like Staps( because I love sport obviously), and I also put ESIR because my sister was actually doing the ""matériaux"" cursus. She was talking of the informatic cursus to me and she was like ""ye you can like it"", so I decided to put ESIR as my first choice. I also went to the Student Saloon, and I talked with some students from the Staps cursus. They explained me the different subjects and I was not interessed at all in every subject except the Sport, but even in the Sport subject, teachers were chosing the sports. So after this Student Saloon, I definitely wanted to don't go to Staps. During the Sallon, i met some people from other schools or IUT or what ever, but I was not interested anymore after a discussion with them. So I put my devolute on ESIR and I did the ""prépa intégré"" and then I joined the school. But now, I have actually no idea for what I want to do after my studies. It's not like i'm not liking Informatic but i'm not liking that that much so i'm in a dubitative mood. I don't really know what to do after ESIR, but I have 2 years to find so it's fine. In ESIR 3, I will try to go to a neighbor country in Stage or for a semester and it can may be open my eyes on something or open my mind.",1

Deep learning in not really a program but mostly a new way of programming, and the result can be a dynamic program.
Concretely, deep learning programs are programs who contently learn and evolving to be more efficient of precise.
One of the most famous deep learning program is AlphaGo. This program was developed by Google DeepMind company who can just play at the Go game. But at the beginning, AlphaGo was loosing all its games, and game after game, AlphaGo learned, and now, AlphaGo win against the first world player.
To be a perform deep learning program, you need a very large database but if you don't have a database, the program can create its own one. For exemple AplhaGo played against itself to learn new techniques and become more stronger.
So, AlphaGo is one of the most famous application of deep learning, but this way of programming has many applications in every domain.
 The deep learning revolution has many application. The most important one is probably in medical domain. Searchers have train a deep learning program to detect cancers or tumors in IRM pictures, and this program is faster than doctors and more efficient with a lesions localisation of 100% and a diagnostic of 90%. Those  medical programs are not going to fully replace doctors but help them to diagnostic and prevent errors. Deep learning programs are also in autonome cars to make them able to self-driving, or prevent a accident and react before human's reaction.
We can imagine a future where deep learning programs will be in every domains and will improve dramatically our life.",0

That was a very intresting experience and i realised that i really wanted to work with them for the rest of my life.
During all this experience i worked with a lot of teacher and seing them made me realised that this work could be for me.

I was absolutely amazed by learning how new technologies could change the way to cure patients, the way to treat many diseases with a lot of innovations.
One of them that makes me suspicious are the GMOs. There are plants, or parts of plants, which are modified by humans to earn special characteristics for example not to died because of pesticides, to resist to insects of predators, not to suffer from the hot or the sun, etc. It also could be modified animals ou any alive modified system. But we have working on plants exclusively. I can give examples of using :
- In developing countries, mostly poor countries like in Africa for instance, there are special rizes that are made to become more nutritional for peoples, and to prevent for diseases like diarrhea.
- There is a kind of OGMs invented to resists to pesticides not to died when farmers use it to destroy unwanted plants.
GMOs are really controlled by European (EFSA) and French (ANSES) control agencies of respect of environnement. In fact, in Paris, OGMs are not authorised to be sold, because the government and scientists criticize the impact on health and environment. They explain they don't have enough hindsight, that there are not affirmations like ""OGMs are safe"" or ""OGMs are dangerous"". Thinkings and opinions seem to be quite differents and perhaps influenced by lobbying and laboratories that want OGMs to be commercialized.
As far as I am concerned, I think I have to show my two points of view.
First, as a scientific student, I'm asking myself about diseases and the influence of OGMs on cancers and degenerative diseases. Maybe OGMs could modified our own genes, our own bacteries? Perhaps I could become allergic? And what about the environment? Studies seem to show that the special culture of thoses plants could affect the ground for many years.
Then, as a common person, by the way, I am a little bit scared by introducing new kind of food in my alimentation routine. Furthermore, one of the key purpose of this innovation is the price. As a student, I sometimes have to make both ends meats simply to be able to eat everyday, so I don't think the cost would be accessible for me. Moreover, what about the taste ? What could proove me that I will love modified-tomatoes as much as classical-tomatoes.
There are many questions I am asking myself. I am not for, I am not cons. I really want to learn more to have a concrete opinion on it.",1

Before internet people learn about news in journal papers on television, even on radio. Now we can search nexs on internet very easily. You don't even need dictionary, we can find everything on internet, with google for example. Every media had a characteristic. With television you can watch, hear, and read, but radio was all about hearing and journal papers was all about reading. Today with internet, you can watch radio, you can hear papers. Internet gather all media on one tool. All you need now is a computer, a smartphone watch tv, hear radio or even read journal papers. Every radio has a website, as journal papers and television. You can find a lot on internet nearly everything. You can buy thing, sell things, watch movies, talk to your friends or family, you can learn and do many more.
 Internet has many consequences, some are good, others are bad. First of all, internet enabled people to learn more. People have access to a lot of knowledge, it helps people to have a wider acces to education. Internet give acces to culture and education to Alex Dupont who wants to. A lot of company, business have grown thnaks to internet. They developp website so they can have business everywhere in the world. Even though internet is a good thing in our society it has also bad effects. People live more behinf a screen, they talk more to people behind screen and less with real contact with others. People are more isolated from others, they have less contact with humans, with interact more behinf a screen. Moreover, people are addicted to internet and all we can do with it.

For the past few years I learn to express my self through different ways such as painting, drawing, writting... but the one within I was feeling the most my self was photography. First with argentic, film camera then with digital camera. To learn more about my new activity, I looked for advices on the internet and i ended up on youtube watching for hours videos of photojournalist talking about their experiences. How they have this pulsion inside of them that was always punching them to go at the nearest of History. How theY wanted to aware about situations of people we decided to not listen, through rough pictures that showes the reality we are away from. I realised that what I wanted to do is to understand the world with his dynamics, is crisis, but also human being and their behaviours.I started to do some research on Parcoursup to find what school would fit me the most, and I found a few journalist school, but unfortunately they were to far away from where i live.  I apply to the Lannion's IUT, but i got refused. Therefor my parents parents kind of pushed me to apply to this licence. So I came here with the idea that info-com was a licence about marketing and business. And to be honest I am pleasantely surprised. I really like hox the professors are expert about their subject, it is obvious but this is a real difference that I noticed compared to highschool. Also with a lot of TD, this is very concrete and we can really explore what we are actually learning. Also, with sociology, we exploring some approch of our present society that i find really interesting to understand what we, as humans are going throug, but also as individual person.
Back in time I would have been discouraged, but now I'm glad I am here.

I began to use a computer 16 years ago and started to play my first games.
Thanks to these I have the will to be a part of a game developper company to create games, maybe in Paris but I am opened to opportunities all around the Earth.
I am always interested to read daily video games and hardware online newspapers in order to be aware of what happens worldwide. I have learned how to built a computer from scratch, how to choose wisely your component, which motherboard, which power supply to be able to work with a specific GPU and CPU. How much spaces do you want for your memory ? At which frequency ? Do you want a SSD or a HDD ? These kind of questions.
I have played a lot of video games, and they have helped me to understand how you can create them. How many people do you need ? What are the specific skills required ? How much does a video game cost to developp ? How long can it take ? I have discovered new types of work, for instance ""level designer"", ""gameplay programmer"", ""qa tester"", ""engine programmer"" and many more. Just take a look at the credits of a video game called ""The Witcher 3"" to be conviced of how much diversity you need to create such big games.
Some persons have taken the responsability to create documentaries, making-of about the topic. To help people understand this world which is still hard to understand from the outside, because there is a big gap between what the players see as a ""consumer"" and what developpers live to create games. It is a very hard work.
Documentaries have helped me to understand the micro-components crisis happening in the world, how it is affecting manufacturers and why some new graphic cards or video games console are barely available and if so, why they are overpriced.",0

It's an application which was founded and lauchned in October 2010 by the American and the Brazilian Alex Dupont.
At the current time, it is one of the most used social networks in the world with Snapchat, Youtube... On Instagram, we can share photos and videos, watch stories. Furthermore, there are two types of accounts, for example companies can be in professional account to have access to more functionnalities and the ordinary people are in private or not, they have the choice.
Finally, know, the name Instagram is built from Insta from the English Instant camera and gram from the English word telegram.
 To begin, i discovered the application Instagram when i was a teenage girl, in high school probably.
To my mind, i think that this application has positive aspects and negative aspects. On the one hand, this application is positive because it has for goal to entertain the people who use it and so have a good time on it. Then, from my point of view, I would say the app is universal because it has so much functionality, besides I'm still discovering some.
On the other side, it can be negative for certain people because they are bad people, who posts a nasty comment or people who are using this social network the wrong way.",0

My name is Alex Dupont, I'm 20 years old. I live in Paris since 2 weeks for my studies. Before, i lived in Paris.
I was in a BTEC International trade and i had the graduation. It was a good experience and i had the chance of make a practices in overseas. It was in Paris during 2 months in a company of teeth care and i was my best experience. Therefor i don't see me work in trade, in a company and forward a computer. The negociation with consumers feel me stress out.
Now i'm in the sciences of education in Rennes 2 because i want to work in social and in particulary with children such as teacher in elementary or nursery school.

The beggining of the explication is quite simple.
I have, in my family, a little brother who’s playing rugby since the age of seven.
At first, I was’nt really concern by his sport. Little by little, I start following his different performances. One day, I was watching a game of his team, and, in the rugby club where He was playing, there was a girl team.
My mother and I talk with the coach and the next week I was in the team.
This was the beggining of a love story.
I start to play rugby seven times a week and even became team’s captain.
When the time to choose what I would like to study after highschool comes, I had only rugby in mind so I started to think of a job that will include it.
Obviously, I can not choose the option of professional athlete because women in rugby are not paid.
So I had to focus on what studies I can do.
In the sport, not everybody can pay or even go to the game of their team. sport is essentially diffuse by medias.
I realised that work in communication will allow me to have contact with rugby or sport in general.
So, basically, I had requesting to the Parcoursup platform to study in a Bachelor formation but there was too many resquest for the place proposed.
So the only solution was the university. At first, I had a lot of pain to accept the fact of leaving my family, my friends and leave in an foreign town, but I think now that is the best formation I could chose.
It offers a lot of things I like such as philosophy, sociology and the study of human behavior.",1
